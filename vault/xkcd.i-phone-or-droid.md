## Transcript
[[A woman sitting at her computer is talking to a man standing behind her.]]
Woman: Well, it depends what you want. The iPhone wins on speed and polish, but the Droid has that gorgeous screen and physical keyboard.

Man: What if I want something more than the pale facsimile of fulfillment brought by a parade of ever-fancier toys? To spend my life restlessly producing instead of sedately consuming?
Man: Is there an app for THAT?

Woman: Yeah, on both.
Woman: Wait, no, looks lke it was rejected from the iPhone store.
Man: Droid it is, then.

{{Title text: It may be a fundamentally empty experience, but holy crap the Droid's 265 ppi screen is amazing.}}
