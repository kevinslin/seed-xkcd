## Transcript
[[A person is sitting at a desk, which is vibrating.]]
<<clatter clatter>>
[[He leans back and turns to face someone sitting at another desk behind him.]]
Person 1: Excuse me--you're jiggling your leg up and down. It's traveling through the floor and making my desk resonate.
Person 2: Oh, I didn't even realize! I'll stop.
[[The first person passes a sheet of paper to the second person.]]
Person 1: Actually, can you just shift the frequency up by 15%? I think you can get resonance with Steve's desk instead.
Person 2: Uh huh . . .
Person 1: Here are the calculations. Let's coordinate and try to spill his drink.
