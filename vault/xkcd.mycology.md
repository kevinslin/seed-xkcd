## Transcript
[[Two children, a girl and a boy, are talking to an adult woman as they walk away from her. The boy has a bucket.]]
Girl: Me and Jack are going up the hill to fetch a pail of water. 

[[The children have left; the woman calls after them.]]
Woman: Okay, have fun! 

[[The woman stands and thinks.]]

Woman: ... wait. What the heck is going on with the hydrology around here?


{{Title text: Jill and Jack 
 began to frack. 
 The oil boosts their town. 
 But fractures make 
 the bedrock shake 
 and Jack came tumbling down.}}
