## Transcript
[[Girl crawling on bed toward boy
narrator.]]
Narrator: It's not something you can turn off.
[[Boy pulling girl, bedspread, and pillow off of bed onto floor.]]
Narrator: A part of me is always detached. 
 Abstracting, looking at numbers and patterns.
[[Girl on top of boy, both under bedspread, on floor. Girl looks to be 'touching' boy.]]
Narrator: When we should be closest, part of me is still alone. 
 Counting the touches of her fingertips. 
 Touch. 
 Touch. 
 Touch touch. 
 Touch touch touch. 
 Touch touch touch touch touch.
[[Same scene as third panel.]]
Narrator: Wait. 
 Is that... 
 That's the Fibonacci Sequence! 
 Whatever I did to deserve you, it couldn't have been enough.
