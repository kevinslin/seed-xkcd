## Transcript
Lecturer: In my paper, I use an extension of the divisor function over the Gaussian integers to generalize the so-called "friendly numbers" into the complex plane. [[Points to equations on the board]]
Guy in room: Hold on.  Is this paper simply a build-up to an "imaginary friends" pun?
[[Lecturer stands speechless]]
Lecturer: It MIGHT not be.
Guy in room: I'm sorry, we're revoking your math license.
