## Transcript
[[A person looks at their phone. Someone speaks to them from out of panel.]]
Other: Hey, what's the temperature outside?
Person: (thinks) Should I give it in ºF or ºC?

[[Above their head, a bulleted list appears.]]
DEGREES CELSIUS
international standard
helps reduce America's weird isolationism
nice how "negative" means below freezing
physics major loyalty
easier to spell
we lost a Mars probe over this crap

[[Another list appears above their head.]]
DEGREES FAHRENHEIT
0ºF to 100ºF good match for temperature range in which most humans live
rounds more usefully (70's, 90's)
unit-aware computing makes Imperial less annoying
SI prefixes less relevant for temperatures
Fahrenheit likely more clear in this context
valuing unit standardization over being helpful possibly makes me a bad friend

[[He's still thinking.]]
Person: (thinks)Crap, gotta pick something. Uhh... (says) ...0.173 radians.
Other: I'll just go check myself.

{{Title text: "Radians Fahrenheit or radians Celsius?" "Uh, sorry, gotta go!"}}
