## Transcript
[[A figure holding a phone is talking to a woman.]]
Figure: Magnus Carlsen has an app where you can play chess against a simulated version of him at different ages. I can beat the 8Â½-year-old, but lose to him at 9. 

Woman: I want that, but for other games. Can I beat 8-year-old Serena Williams at tennis? Swim laps faster than a 6-year-old Michael Phelps? 
Figure: We should make a simulator. 

Figure: ...Why limit it to games? Can I cook a better chicken than 11-year-old Martha Stewart? 
Woman: Win an election against 12-year-old JFK? 

[[The figures are sitting at laptops, with a stack of books between them.]]
Soon...
Woman: Looks like 8-year old Magnus Carlsen can swim faster than 9-year-old Martha Stewart. 
Figure: But they both lose a hot-dog-eating contest to 2-year-old Secretariat. 
Woman: This project has gotten weird.

{{Title text: In the latest round, 9-year-old Muhammad Ali beat 10-year-old JFK at air hockey, while Secretariat lost the hot-dog-eating crown to 12-year-old Ken Jennings. Meanwhile, in a huge upset, 11-year-old Martha Stewart knocked out the adult Ronda Rousey.}}
