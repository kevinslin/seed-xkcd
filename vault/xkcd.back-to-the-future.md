## Transcript
{{Title: Back to the Future}}
[[A man and a woman are standing, talking to one another]]
Man: This weekend, my professor friend built a time machine out of a DeLorean and I went back in time! I helped make sure my parents got together and helped my dad to be less of a loser.
Woman: Wow! Do you still have the time machine?
Man: Nah. But I did what I really needed to do.
Woman: Uh huh.
[[Neither says anything]]
Woman: Okay, you remember that my father was in the WTC North Tower, right? 
Man: Yeah...why?
Woman: I...nothing.
