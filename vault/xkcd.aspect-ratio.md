## Transcript
[[A car is crushed and broken between two tall black rectangles. The rectangles are attached to screw clamps applying pressure from each end. The tyres are flat, the windows are broken, and the bodywork is crumpled.]]
Whenever someone uploads a letterboxed 16:9 video rescaled to 4:3, I do this to their car.
