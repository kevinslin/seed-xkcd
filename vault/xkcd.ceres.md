## Transcript
[[A character is engrossed in a laptop at a desk, while a standing character looks on silently.]]
Sitting character: "Dawn" has almost reached Ceres.
Sitting character: I'm excited that we'll finally learn what that stupid white dot is.

[[A blurry and small planet, hung on an inky starless backdrop. We can faintly see a white dot.]]

[[The planet is enlarged to fill the whole frame, and we can see there is some text on the white dot.]]

[[Only a small portion of the planet is visible, and we can see details of its surface. We can see that quite unlike the surface of the planet, the white dot is a giant crisp sticker, with a message in huge letters.]]
Inspected by no. 6
