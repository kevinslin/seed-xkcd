## Transcript
[[The man in the black hat is standing next to a vanity cabinet, with a broken mirror on the floor.  Another chap is in the room with him.]]
Black Hat: Oops.  Guess this means seven more years of the illusion that my actions somehow influence the indifferent hand of probability which governs our lives.

[[Black hat guy stares at the shards of glass on the floor.]]

Chap: Plus like half an hour of sweeping.
Black Hat: No, I think I'll leave it.
Chap: You'll get glass in your feet.

[[Black hat guy holds up a shard of glass, looks at it.]]
Black Hat: Eccles. 9:2 - All things come alike to all: To the clean, and to the unclean.
Black Hat: My fate is as these shards.
Chap: Dude, chill, it's just a vanity mirror.
Black Hat: 
All
 is vanity mirrors.
