## Transcript
((Panel consists of a large equation with call-out text indicating what each variable indicates))
P = Wp x (Cr + Mi) x Tk x F0 + F1 x Dt X Au Â˜ 100,000
Wp (7,000,000,000) World Population
Cr (1
10 000) Fraction of people who imagine an alien encounter because they're crazy or want to feel special
Mi (1
10 000) Fraction of people who misinterpret a physical or physiological experience as an alien sighting
Tk (1
10) Probability that they'll tell someone
F0 (10) Average number of people they tell
F1 (10) Average number of people each friend tells this "firsthand" account
Dt (9
10) Probability that any details not fitting the narrative will be revised or forgotten in retelling
Au (1
100) Fraction of people with the means and motivation to share the story with a wider audience (blogs, forums, reporters)

Even with conservative guesses for the values of the variables, this suggests there must be a 
huge
 number of credible-sounding alien sightings out there, available to anyone who wants to believe!
