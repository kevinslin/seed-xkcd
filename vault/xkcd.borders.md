![Eventually a UN is set up.  And then a lone rebel runs down the line of flags in front of it, runs back to his base, and gets a kajillion points.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/borders.png)

## Transcript
[[Two stick figures stand on a hill overlooking a great city. Between them and the city stands an embassy flying a red flag.]]
THREE YEARS AGO, THE KINGDOM OF LIATE OVERTHREW THEIR OLD ORDER AND ESTABLISHED A CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY. OUR LEADERS SIGNED A TREATY WITH THEIR QUEEN, AND OUR BORDERS WERE SET BY THE YABRIS ACCORDS.
MANY SAID WAR WOULD BE UNENDING, THAT PEACE WOULD ALWAYS BE A DREAM DEFERRED. BUT TODAY, OUR FLAG FLIES PROUDLY OVER OUR EMBASSY IN THEIR KINGDOM, AND THEY WALK OUR LANDS WITHOUT FEAR.
SO COME, TRAVELER. LAY DOWN YOUR GRUDGES AND JOIN US IN BROTHERHOOD. IT IS TIME NOT TO FIGHT, BUT TO LIVE.
[[Stick figure sitting at computer]]
THIS IS THE WORST CAPTURE-THE-FLAG SERVER EVER.
