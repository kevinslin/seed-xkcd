![So he's saying that God thought Hitler's art was so bad that the Holocaust was an acceptable alternative.  It's no secret that the hat guy is closely based on Aram, from Men in Hats.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/hitler.jpg)

## Transcript
Learning about the Holocaust has really shaken my belief in God.
You know, as a young man, Hitler was rejected from art school.
Yeah... shame he didn't get in
Well, have you seen any of his paintings? They're awful. Defy all rules of composition.
What are you suggesting?
Maybe there is a god, but he's a real art lover.
This is why I don't go out in public with you.
