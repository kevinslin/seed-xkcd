## Transcript
((This comic is a 1D chart, from least to most willing, of tolerance to deal with technical arcana. A stick figure labelled 'me' stands at the central point.))
Willingness to wade through some 80's programmer's arcane bullshit: 
Low: Never learn to program
Me: Learn enough to break everything but not enough to fix it
High: Spend all your time compiling kernels and never make anything

{{Title text: Learning arcane bullshit from the 80s can break your computer, but if you're willing to wade through arcane bullshit from programmers in the 90s and 2000s, you can break everyone else's computers, too.}}
