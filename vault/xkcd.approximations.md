## Transcript
A table of slightly wrong equations and identities useful for approximations and
or trolling teachers. (Found using a mix of trial-and-error, Mathematica, and Robert Munafo's Ries tool.)  All units are SI MKS unless otherwise noted.

Relation:
One light year(m) ~= 
99^8
Accurate to within: 
one part in 40

Relation:
Earth Surface(m^2) ~=
69^8
Accurate to within:
one part in 130

Relation: 
Ocean's volume(m^3) ~=
9^19
Accurate to within:
one part in 70

Relation:
Seconds in a year ~=
75^4
Accurate to within:
one part in 400

Relation:
Seconds in a year (rent method) ~=
525,600 x 60
Accurate to within:
one part in 1400

Relation:
Age of the universe (seconds) ~=
15^15
Accurate to within:
one part in 70

Relation:
Planck's constant ~=
1
(30^pi^e)
Accurate to within:
one part in 110

Relation:
Fine structure constant ~=

140
Accurate to within:
[I've had enough of this 137 crap]

Relation:
Fundamental charge ~=

(14 * pi^pi^pi)
Accurate to within:

(e^((1+(8)^(1
(e-1))^(1
pi))

Relation:
Jenny's Constant ~=
(7^(e
1- 1
e) - 9) * pi^2

Intermission: World Population Estimate which should stay current for a decade or two:
Take the last two digits of the current year
Example: 20[14] 
Subtract the number of leap years since hurricane Katrina
Example:14 (minus 2008 and 2012) is 12
Add a decimal point
Example: 1.2
Add 6
Example: 6 + 1.2
7.2 ~= World population in billions.

Version for US population:
Example: 20[14]
Subtract 10
Example: 4
Multiply by 3
Example: 12
Add 10
Example: 3[22] million
