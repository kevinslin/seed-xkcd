## Transcript
[[A person approaches another person sitting in a chair]]
Person 1: Remember how flashlights sucked when we were kids? Always dim and finicky?
Person 2: I guess?

[[They walk to the door]]
Person 1: Well, I discovered there are now internet flashlight enthusiasts.
-
And the technology has... improved.
Person 2: Ok, let's see.

[[As they walk outside into the night, Person 1 turns his flashlight on.  An enormous incandescence springs forth.  Person 2 shies away for a moment.]]
<<FWOOSH>>

Person 1: See how it lights up the whole forest?
Person 2: ..the trees are on fire.
Person 1: Real bright, though.
