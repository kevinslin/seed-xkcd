## Transcript
[[Beret Guy walks in, followed by a.. "prospective hire"]]
Beret Guy; Welcome to our company! We're headquartered here, in this real building I found!

[[Both people sit down at a table.  "Hire" has a tray with food and a beverage.  Beret Guy has a bowl.  There is a power outlet labeled "Soup" in the adjacent wall. A small roll of wire sits next to Beret Guy's chair]]
"Hire": What do you.. *do*?
Beret Guy: We make stuff for phones! Like apps and stickers!

[[Beret Guy grabs the roll of wire]]
Beret Guy: We want to hire you to write on our computers.  we can offer you a bunch of paychecks! There are ghosts here.

[[Beret Guy unrolls the wire and plugs it into the wall]]
"Hire": ..are you sure this is a company?
Beret Guy: I hope so!

[[Something one can only hope is soup streams out of the wire into Beret Guy's bowl]]
