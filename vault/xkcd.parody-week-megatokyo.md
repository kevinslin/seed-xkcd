## Transcript
[["megaxkcd" in Japanese quote characters.  An anime girl with pigtails, long rectangular earrings and a blank expression stands with her arms at her sides.]]
Narration: In today's megaxkcd, our protagonist comes to terms with his romantic love for a girl who is a video game console accessory.
Man 1: Wait, I'm not sure we should parody megatokyo.
Man 2: Fred Gallagher does seem like he might take it kind of hard.
Man 1: He really does.
Man 2: Poor guy.  We should try to cheer him up.
[[Man 1 and Man 2 stand in front of a profile shot of a house.  On the left is a mailbox.  Man 2 stands at street level, while Man 1 is holding a cake on the top of a two-step staircase to the front door.]]
Man 2: Fred?  Fred, please come out.  It's OK.  Don't cry, Fred.
Man 1: We... we baked you a cake.
