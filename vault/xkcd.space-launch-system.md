## Transcript
Person 1: Check out the SLS - 130 tons to orbit.  Finally, rockets that improve on the ones we had 40 years ago.
Black Hat Man: Are we getting Nazis to build those ones too?

Person 1, offscreen: What?
Black Hat Man, offscreen: When we first captured von Braun and his team, we had our engineers interview them, then *we* built the rockets.  But our rockets kept exploding

Black Hat Man, narrating: Eventually we gave up and had the German teams do it, and they built us the Saturn V moon rocket.  
[[The Saturn V gracefully arcing across the night sky]]

Person 1: I'm.. not sure what lesson to take from that.
Black Hat Man: "If you want something done right ,learning from the Nazis isn't enough.  You have to actually put them in charge.
Person 1: That's a *terrible* lesson.
Black Hat Man: Then I guess you should get a Nazi to come up with a better one.
