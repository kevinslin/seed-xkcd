## Transcript
[[A figure sits at a desk with a laptop. A woman is off-screen.]]
Figure: Argh! 
Woman: What? 
Figure: Why do I always have these inexplicable, impossible-to-diagnose computer problems? 

[[The woman walks up to the desk.]]
Figure: After six hours of this, I've concluded nothing works or makes sense. I give up on logic. 
Woman: <<sigh>>Gimme. I'll figure it out. 
Figure: You won't. 

[[The figure sits at his laptopless desk. Off-screen, we can hear the woman working on it. 
<<Type type>>
<<Click>>
Woman: ?
<<Type type type>>
Woman: ???

[[The woman is back in front of the desk, clutching the laptop.]]
Figure: How'd it go? 
Woman: Your computer is literally haunted. 
Figure: Told you.
