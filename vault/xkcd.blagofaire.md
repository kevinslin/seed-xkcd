## Transcript
Man in Red Cape and Goggles: Hey, it worked!
Man: What? Who are you?
Man in Red Cape and Goggles: I'm from the distant future.
Man: Wow.  Hi!
Man in Red Cape and Goggles: Are you a blogger?  I play one of you at our festivals!
Man: Huh?
Man in Red Cape and Goggles: Like the ren faires of your time - I do reenactments.
Man in Red Cape and Goggles: We relive the days when the internet was new and free.  The days of risky sharing, slashdot, the myspace music renaissance.  The generation's finest minds meeting on comment threads, battling roving bands of trolls, and holding the great dialogues of the age!
