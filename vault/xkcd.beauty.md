## Transcript
[[Two humans are discussing science.  They are interrupted by an off-panel shout.]]
Human: The problem with scientists is that you take the wonder and beauty out of everything by trying to analyze it.
Shout: Dude!

[[A Scientist runs across the panel, carrying a microscope and a slime mold.]]
Scientist: My plasmoidal slime molds have heightened pigment production! Check out that yellow color! That actually makes them zinc-resistatn. Amazing, huh?

[[The slime mold is proferred to the same human who was speaking earlier.  The close up hides the Scientist's face.]]
Human: It looks like dog barf.
Scientist: Hah, yeah! F. Septica is nicknamed "dog vomit slime mold."  Cool, huh?  Check out my slides!

[[The scientist has set down the microscope on the floor of the panel, and the slime mold is jiggling.]]
Human: Okay, never mind: What's wrong with scientists is that you 
do
 see wonder and beauty in everything.
Human: Oh God, it's 
moving!

Scientist: It wants to hug you! So cute!
