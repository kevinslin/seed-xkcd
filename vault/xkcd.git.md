## Transcript
[[3 people stand in front of a laptop on a desk.  Person 3 just stands there and learns]]
Person 1: This is git. It tracks collaborative work on projects through a beautiful distributed graph theory tree model.
Person 2: Cool. How do we use it?
Person 1: No idea. Just memorize these shell commands and type them to sync up.
If you get errors, save your work elsewhere, delete the project, and download a fresh copy.
