## Transcript
[[A figure stands behind a woman sitting at a desk with a computer on it.]]
Figure: When a user takes a photo, the app should check whether they're in a national park...
Woman programmer: Sure, easy GIS lookup. Gimme a few hours. 
Figure: ... and check whether the photo is of a bird. 
Woman programmer: I'll need a research team and five years.
