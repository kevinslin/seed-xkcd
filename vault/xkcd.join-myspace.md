## Transcript
[[Guy with black hat is talking to another guy]]
Guy: Dude, you should get on MySpace.
Black Hat: Eh, I don't think so.
Guy: C'mon. There's no real reason not to except snobbiness. It's the new social scene.
Black Hat: I know. I'm just not interested.
Guy: Please? I'll friend you.
Black Hat: Carebearstare.
Guy: What?
[[Black Hat shoots a rainbow colored ray from his chest - the Care Bear Stare. It throws Guy to the edge of the panel, pinned to the wall.]]
