## Transcript
[[A woman sits at a bar, a man approaches.]]
Man: So, how do you like your eggs in the morning?
Woman: Ooh, sunny side up.
Man: Oh. Huh.
Woman: Is that a problem?
Man: Well, it's just that I was trying to set you up for the "unfertilised" line.
Woman: Ah. Bad timing; I'm actually looking for casual sex. ...interested?
Man: I'd love to, but I've got like 20 more jokes to set up tonight. Hey, have you seen a priest and a rabbi?
