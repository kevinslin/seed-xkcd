## Transcript
HOW TO DRAW A STAR:
[[A slightly curved line is drawn, starting with a point near the top center of the panel, and going downward and to the left at approximately a 23-degree angle, with an arrow at the end.]]

[[Another slightly curved line goes up and to the right, creating a 34-degree angle with the first line.]]
So far so good...

[[A third line goes up and to the left, creating a 58-degree angle with the last line. The drawing now sort of resembles a tent being blown over in the wind.]]
Steady as she goes...

[[The fourth line goes down and to the right, creating an approximately 47-degree angle with the last line, and our star is beginning to look a bit askew.]]
...uh oh.


Shitshitshit

[[The fifth line comes up at a 48-degree angle, completely missing the first point by a mile, and our star has failed spectacularly.]]

ABORT!


ABORT!
