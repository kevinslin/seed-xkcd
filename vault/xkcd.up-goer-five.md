US Space Team's Up Goer Five
[NASA's Saturn V]
The only flying space car that's taken anyone to another world.
[The only spacecraft to take anyone somewhere other than Earth]
(Explained using only the ten hundred [thousand] words people use the most often)

((The following is a top-to-bottom description of the various parts of the Saturn V, alternating between the limited-vocabulary version and the technical version))

Thing to help people escape really fast if there's a problem and everything is on fire so they decide not to go to space
[Launch Escape System]

Thing to control which direction the escaping people go.
[Launch Escape System pitch motor]

Stuff to burn to make the box with the people in it escape *really fast*
[Launch Escape Motor]

Place where fire comes out to help them escape.
[Launch Escape Motor nozzles]

Part that flies around the other world and comes back home with the people in it and falls in the water.
[Apollo Command Module; includes "People Box, Door, Chairs"]

Part that goes along to give people air, water, computers and stuff. It comes back home with them, but burns up without landing.
[Apollo Service module]

Cold Air for burning (and breathing). This part had a *very* big problem once.
[oxygen tank; was the tank that exploded during the Apollo 13 incident]

Part that flies down to the other world with two people inside
[Lunar Module]

Part that stays on the other world (It's still there)
[Lunar Module Descent Stage]

Feet that go on the ground of the other world 
[Lunar Module Descent Stage landing gear]

Ring holding most of the computers
[Instrument Unit]

Part that falls off third (this part flew away from our world into space and hit the world we were going toward)
[Third stage]

Things holding that kind of air that makes your voice funny (It's for filling up the space left when they take the cold air out to burn it)
[Helium tank]

The kind of air that once burned a big sky bag and people died and someone said "Oh the [humans]!" (used for burning) (wet and *very* cold)
[Liquid Hydrogen tank]

The part of air you need to breathe, but not the other stuff (used for burning)(wet and *very* cold)
[Liquid Oxygen tank]

Fire comes out here
[J-2 Third stage engine]

Part that falls off second
[Second stage]

More sky bag air (for burning)(cold + wet)
[Liquid Hydrogen tank, Second stage]

More breathing-type air (for burning)(cold + wet)
[Liquid Oxygen tank, Second stage]

Thing that brings in cold wet air to burn
[Fuel tank input, Second stage]

Fire comes out here
[5 J-2 Second stage engines]

Part that falls off first
[First stage]

More breathing-type air (for burning)(cold + wet)
[Liquid Oxygen tank, First stage]

More funny voice air (for filling up space)
[Helium tank, First stage]

Opening for putting in cold wet air
[Liquid oxygen tank input, First stage]

This is full of that stuff they burned in lights before houses had power.  It goes together with the cold air when it's time to start going up.
[Kerosene tank, First stage]

Lots of fire comes out here
[5 F-1 First stage engines]

[[Description of bottom end]]
This end should point toward the ground if you want to go to space. If it starts pointing toward space, you are having a bad problem and you will not go to space today.

{{Title text: Another thing that is a bad problem is if you're flying toward space and the parts start to fall off your space car in the wrong order. If that happens, it means you won't go to space today, or maybe ever.}}
