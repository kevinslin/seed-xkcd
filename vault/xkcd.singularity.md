## Transcript
((This strip is laid out like a Wikipedia contents table.))
I love reading the Wikipedia talk entries for articles on individual cities
Contents [hide]
1 Origin of city's name? 
1.1 Idea for a better name
1.2 Not how Wikipedia works
2 Too much promotion of lake festival
3 Should we mention the murders? 
3.1 Not that notable
3.2 All cities have murders
4 Quote verification: even if Voltaire did visit (unlikely), why would he get so angry about our restaurants? 
5 Discuss: new picture
5.1 Current one looks awfully bleak
5.2 Gray sky
5.3 What about this one
5.4 Also bleak
5.5 Maybe this place just looks that way
5.6 Found a better picture, more colourful
5.7 That's a shot from Disney's Zootopia
6 "Mining disasters" section too long
6.1 Not really Wikipedia's fault
6.2 Why is this town so bad at mining?
7 Infobox picture: I just realised you can see a murder happening in the background
7.1 This city is terrible
7.2 Photoshopped out murder
7.3 Can someone just take a better picture
7.4 Okay, uploaded a new picture
7.5 Wait, never mind, I just noticed there's a murder in this one, too
8 1982 secession still in effect?
9 I think the murderer is reverting my edits
10 Why does this article take any position on correct condom use, let alone such a weird and ambiguous one?
11 Train station "designed by Andrew Lloyd Webber"?
11.1 They probably mean Frank Lloyd Wright
11.2 I thought so too, but it's apparently not a mistake
11.3 Didn't know he did architecture
11.4 Roof collapse

{{Title text: I don't think the Lakeshore Air Crash Museum really belongs under 'Tourist Attractions.' It's not a museum--it's just an area near the Lake Festival Laser Show where a lot of planes have crashed.}}
