## Transcript
[[Stick figure is sitting at a desk with a computer, typing]]
Monitor: People try to shut us d-d-down 
 just 'cause our music gets around
[[Stick figure is standing on his chair and typing with his keyboard across his hip.]]
Monitor: Old folks act like total noobs 
 get off our net; _you_ block the tubes
[[Stick figure is really wailing on the keyboard.]]
Monitor: Why don't you all just d-d-disconnect 
 and don't try an' grok our d-d-dialect
[[Stick figure smashes the keyboard into the monitor.]]
Monitor: I'm not tryin' to cause a big s-s-sensation 
 I'm just bloggin' bout my generation
