## Transcript
Highway Engineer Pranks:
[[Each panel depicts a highway intersection.]]
The Inescapable Cloverleaf:
[[Roads lead onto the rings for each leaf, but then are trapped in the circles.  Minor roads also allow travel between the rings.]]

The Zero-Choice Interchange:
[[On and off-ramps exist, but they lead back to the same lane they disconnected from.]]

The Rotary Supercollider:
[[The roads lead into a traffic circle, and then a loop reverses the direction of flow so all the roads run into each other.]]
