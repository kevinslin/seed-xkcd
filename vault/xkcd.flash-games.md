## Transcript
[[On the left side of the panel, is a massive TV screen, large speakers, and similar devices, all connected to a "Game Station 20,000" console. A man, however, is over on the right side of the panel, on a modestly-sized computer.]]
Man: Ooh, I think I've got it figured out! Okay, one more hour.
