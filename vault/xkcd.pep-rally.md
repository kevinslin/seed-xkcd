## Transcript
[[A cheerleader stands in front of crowded bleachers.]]
[[The cheerleader is waving pompoms.]]
Cheerleader: Lakeview High is the best!
Crowd: Yeah!
Someone: Wait, why?

Cheerleader: What?
Voice: A guy on the North High football team helped me rebuild my deck.
Voice: It seems ungrateful to presume we're better.

Voice: I mean, school districts are just based on zip codes.
Voice #2: Their principal donated a kidney to my dad.

Voice: I'm texting with my friend there now. He says it's okay, and we're invited to their events if we want.
Voice: But he sounded kind of hurt.
Voice #2: Why are we doing this, rally, again?
[[The cheerleader looks dejected.]]
