![My all-time favorite example of syntactic ambiguity comes from Wikipedia: 'Charlotte's Web is a children's novel by American author E. B. White, about a pig named Wilbur who is saved from being slaughtered by an intelligent spider named Charlotte.'](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/cirith_ungol.png)

## Transcript
[[A character in a long flowing robe holds up a lantern in one hand; the One Ring is dangling from a necklace in the other.  The scene is a cave, profuse with spiderwebs, bones hanging in some of them.  On one of the webs are words, presumably written by the spider.]]
