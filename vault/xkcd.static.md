## Transcript
[[It's dark. There are only the voices of a man and his lover.]]

Lover: Hang on, I can't see--did you put on a condom?
Man: It's okay. I've got a wrist thing on.

Lover: A what? Let me see that.
<<fumble>>
Lover: This is an anti-static strap.

Man: You mean it doesn't ...
Lover: No. Why would you even THINK that?
Man: I guess I was mixed up.

Man: Wait, so when I was replacing that RAM last week ...
Lover: Yeah, I THOUGHT that was weird.
Man: Oh, but it explains why the geek squad fired me.
