## Transcript
[[A man sits at a computer, hand over the keyboard]]
Computer: Okay, human.
Man: Huh?
Computer: Before you hit 'compile,' listen up.
Computer: You know when you're falling asleep, and you imagine yourself walking or something, and suddenly you misstep, stumble, and jolt awake?
Man: Yeah!
Computer: Well, that's what a segfault feels like. <<Pause>> Double-check your damn pointers, okay?
