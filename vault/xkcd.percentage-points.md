## Transcript
[[An average news anchor reading news copy of below average intelligence appears on a TV, with one person watching it in utter disgust]]
News Anchor: Senator Grayton's campaign has imploded following the candidate's promise to give tax breaks to drunk drivers and to authorize the use of unmanned Predator drones in the War On Christmas.  Grayton had been polling at 20%, but his support has since plunged by 19%.
I hate the ambiguity created when people don't distinguish between percentages and percentage points.
