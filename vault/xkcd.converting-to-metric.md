Guide to Converting to Metric
The key to converting to metric is establishing
new reference points.  When you hear "26 degrees centigrade",
instead of thinking "That's 79 degrees fahrenheit" you should think,
"that's warmer then a house but cool for swimming."
here are some helpful tables of reference points:
Temperature:
60 degrees centigrade - Earth's Hottest
45 degrees centigrade - Dubai Heat Wave
40 degrees centigrade - Southern US Heat Wave
35 degrees centigrade - Northern US Heat Wave
30 degrees centigrade - Beach weather
25 degrees centigrade - Warm Room
20 degrees centigrade - Room Temperature
10 degrees centigrade - Jacket Weather
0 degrees centigrade - Snow!
-5 degrees centigrade - Cold Day (Boston)
-10 degrees centigrade - Cold Day (Moscow)
-20 degrees centigrade - FuckFuckFuckCold
-30 degrees centigrade - Fuuuuuuuuuuuuck!
-30 degrees centigrade - Spit goes "ckink"
