## Transcript
[[On a blackboard.]]
(Plank energy
Pressure at the Earth's core) x (Prius combined EPA gas mileage
Minimum width of the English Channel) = pi

[[A teacher indicates this equation with a pointer in front of a class.]]
Teacher: It's correct to within experimental error, and the units check out. It must be a fundamental law.
Student: But what if they build a better Prius?
Teacher (italic): Then England will drift out to sea.
