## Transcript
[[A crime scene is surrounded in tape.  A large black pool is on the ground, with splashes around it, and some sort of tool.  Two people are standing outside the tape.]]
Policeman: Looks like a murder-suicide.
George: Any interesting mathematical patterns?
Policeman: No, George, just two dead bodies and a lot of blood.
George: Two... that's the third Fibonacci number!
Policeman: Not now, George.

When Mathnet shut down, the officers had trouble reintegrating into the regular L.A.P.D.
