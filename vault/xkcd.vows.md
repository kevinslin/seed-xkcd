## Transcript
[[A bride and groom stand next to each other. Each has a hand outstretched toward the other.]]
Officiator (out of panel): Do you take this man to be your lawful wedded husband?
Bride: ...no.

[[The groom steps back in surprise. The bride removes her wig to reveal she is a man.]]
Groom: 
What? Amy!?

Bride: I'm not Amy. None of this was real. You're back in senior year. It's the big game.

[[The groom puts his hands to his head in confusion. The "bride" holds up a football, still holding the wig in his other hand.]]
Groom: What 
is
 this!?
Bride: 
The greatest high school football misdirection play of all time.


[[The groom puts his hands to his mouth as the man in the wedding dress begins to run backwards, away from him.]]

((Outside the final panel.))
[[The groom remains frozen in horror as the "bride" turns and dashes toward the goalpost in the distance.]]
