[[A girl is kneeling on the floor, playing a card game.]]
Girl: Hah! -- Welcome to Suckville - population: 
you.


[[A guy is sitting on the floor opposite her, also playing the game.]]
Guy: Why are you using 2000 census data? -- That's an old figure.

[[The girl turns around from the game to look at her laptop, which is sitting on the floor behind her.]]
