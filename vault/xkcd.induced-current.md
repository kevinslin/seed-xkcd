## Transcript
[[A man wearing a beret, extension cord in hand, approaches Randall as he works at his computer.]]
Beret: Can I plug my extension cord over here?
Randall: No.
Beret: Why?
Randall: Solar Flares.
[[A diagram is displayed, illustrating the Earth's magnetic field being permanently impacted by a large solar flare (represented by a large arrow).]]
[[A second diagram is presented, illustrating the Earth's rotation and the resulting impact that the solar flare would have on the earth's magnetic field. ]]
Randall: A large solar flare could dent the Earth's magnetic field inwards. The Earth's spin could then induce a strong current in any long conductors, melting them and starting fires. By extending your cord, you could kill us all.
[[Stunned, the man wearing the beret looks down at the cord he carries.]]
Beret: Really?
Randall: Warn your friends.
[[Dejected, the man walks away, cord in tow.]]
[[Randall looks up from his computer as he is braced by his girlfriend, a stern look in her face.]]
Girlfriend: That was MEAN.
Randall: Listen, SOMEBODY has to keep MythBusters in business. Next season should be fun.
