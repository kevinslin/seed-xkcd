## Transcript
[[Two figures are walking along, chatting.]]
Figure: Hear about that "impossible" microwave thruster? 

[[The figures stop walking and look at each other.]]
Woman: Yeah. Let me get this straight - they pumped 20 kilowatts into a box under ambient conditions... and it only twitched a *little*?
Figure: Yeah. 

[[The figures continue walking. We see them in silhouette.]]
Woman: *That's* surprising. If you umped 20 kilowatts into *me*, I'd twitch a *lot*. 
Figure: But you're not pushing on the quantum vacuum.
Woman: I *might* be. I do a lot of things. 
Figure: I guess we can't be sure.
