## Transcript
Groundhog Day really didn't end that way.  When Bill Murray finally slept with Rita, it *didn't* break the loop. [[Phil Connors and Rita gettin' busy under the covers of his bed]]

They just kept having sex, night after night, [[bed containing Phil and Rita repeats]] February 2nd after February 2nd... [[calendar page repeats]] ..forever

But nothing is forever. Not even forever

And the day *after* that sexual infinity [[calendar page here]] was February 3rd. 

264 days later (the length of a pregnancy) was october 23rd -- [[An enormous explosion in space]] Bishop Ussher's date for the birth of our world.
