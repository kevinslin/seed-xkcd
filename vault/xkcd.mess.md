!['Sorry, I left out my glass of water from last night.' OH GOD I APPARENTLY LIVE IN A GARBAGE PIT.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/mess.png)

## Transcript
[[Two figures walk into a bedroom. There's a bed, a picture on the wall, some curtains, a rug, and one item on the floor. On the whole, the room is immaculate.]]
Figure 1: Sorry it's such a disaster in here.
Figure 2: {{inside a thought bubble}} whoa- what's wrong with me?
My room never looks as nice as the rooms other people apologize for.
