## Transcript
[[Aang the Avatar and Dmitri Mendeleev stand in opposition to each other.  Aang wields all 4 classical elements: Water, Fire, Earth, and Air.]]
Aang: I'm the avatar, master of all 4 elements!
Mendeleev: Really? I'm Mendeleev, master of all 118+. 
<<swoosh>>
Mendeleev: That was polonium-bending.  You probably didn't feel anything, but the symptoms of radiation poisoning will set in shortly.
