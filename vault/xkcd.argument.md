## Transcript
[[A thread on the "Free energy forum" messageboard.  The title reads: "You're all crackpots who don't understand thermodynamics."  Page 547 of 547, with comments including "No, idiot, only the *north* end of a magnet increases entropy. The south end decreases it", "I wiki'd this "first law" and I don't see the issue. My device isn't a robot and doesn't harm humans.", and "What if we trick the government into only suppressing the *left* side of the flywheel?".]]
Ironically, the argument I started on a perpetual motion forum in 2004 shows no signs of slowing down.
