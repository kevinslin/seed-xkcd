## Transcript
[[A man in a car, sitting at a red light.]]
Man: This light always takes forever.  I'd like to smack the idiot who designed this intersection.
[[An engineer steps up onto the hood of the man's car.]]
Engineer: Hi.
Man: Who the hell are you?
Engineer: I designed this intersection.
Engineer [[arms spread outward]] : You're right - I should have just made the light shorter! Never mind the hours of simulation and testing I did.  Never mind that this intersection interacts with it's neighbors in a complicated way and it took me a week to work out timing sequences that avoided total jams.
Engineer: Clearly, I'm a crappy engineer and you have a better solution.  Go on, show me your proposed timings.
Man: Get the hell off my hood before I start driving and fling you into traffic.
Engineer: You can't.  Light's red.
Man: Well, when will it change?
Engineer: Tuesday.
