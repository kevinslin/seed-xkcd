Image Caption: Possibly a haberdasher?
News Anchor: Attempts to reach the nominee at home were unsuccessful.
Reporter: What the hell kind of apartment has a moat?
News Anchor: To understand the culture from which he came--and which he may soon administer--we sent a reporter to what we're told is the source of that culture. Tom?
Tom: I'm coming to you live from the 4chan

Pilot: Can't, sir. The tubes just went down completely.
Ron Paul: Blast!
Ron Paul: Then we'll go ourselves. Full speed ahead!
