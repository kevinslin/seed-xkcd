## Transcript
[[One person is pointing to a huge flatscreen HDTV on the wall. The other is holding a cell phone.]]
HDTV Owner: Check out my new HDTV--a beautiful, high-def 1080p.
Friend: Wow, that's over TWICE the horizontal resolution of my cell phone.
Friend: In fact, it almost beats the LCD monitor I got in 2004.

It baffles me that people find HDTV impressive.
