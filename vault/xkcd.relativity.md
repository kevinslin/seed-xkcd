![It's commonly believed that Lorentz contraction makes objects appear flatter along the direction of travel. However, this ignores light travel times. In fact, a fast-moving butt would appear rotated toward the observer but not substantially distorted. Shakira was right.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/relativity.png)

## Transcript
[[We see a head and shoulders view of Einstein. He looks ponderous.]]
((Einstein's "line" is in a thought bubble.))
Einstein: If I were traveling at the speed of light, my butt would look *awesome*.
Einstein was famed for his Gedankedank.
