## Transcript
Person 1: You know that giant hamster ball you've always wanted? I just found out that Wayne Coyne from the Flaming Lips crowd-surfs in one.
Person 2: Let's go.

Some Weeks Later ...
[[Wayne Coyne is, in fact, crowd-surfing in a giant hamster ball.]]
Person: Ready?
Friends: Ready.

Person: Now!
<<shove>>
[[People on both sides shove the crowd out of the way, causing Coyne in his ball to fall to the ground.]]
Wayne Coyne: Hey!

Person: Okay, push!
[[Person and friends start pushing the ball away, as the crowd looks on.]]

[[Some roll him up the ramp into the back of a semi, while others hold the crowd back and one stands by to drive.]]
Wayne Coyne: Help!

[[The truck drives off, leaving the audience in a cloud of dust.]]
