!['But what's the buzz about the film?' 'We're hoping it's distracting.'](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/premiere.png)

## Transcript
[[Standard vacuous entertainment newscast. An anchor starts off the segment with an inset feed of a field reporter]]
In-studio News Anchor: All Hollywood is in town or tonight's star-studded premier! We go live to our reporter on the red carpet. How do things look?

[[Field reporter feed switches to fullscreen. The reporter is stating on the red carpet in front of a full crowd.]]
Field reporter: Bleak. In 800 million years, the aging, brightening sun will boil away the oceans, and all this will be blowing sand.

[[Switch back to initial framing]]
Anchor: Oh. Um.  ..sounds pretty grim.  How are the stars reacting?
Reporter: Hydrogen fusion. But it won't last forever.
Anchor. I mean the *movie* stars.
Reporter: They won't last forever either. None of us will.
