## Transcript
[[ A figure wakes up to an apparition hovering over their bed. ]]
Apparition: OOOOOOOOOOOOooooo
Figure: A ghost!?
Apparition: I bring a 
cautionary vision
 of things to come!

Apparition: This is the future:
[[ Two people are standing between a pair of houses.  There is a tree.  An airplane flies past. ]]

Apparition: And 
this
 is the future if you give up the fight over the word "literally":
[[ Two people are standing between a pair of houses.  There is a tree.  An airplane flies past.  The cynical might suggest the panel is copy pasted.

[[ Back to the figure in bed. ]]
Figure: They looked exactly the same.
Apparition: OOOOOOOOOOOooooo
Figure: Ok, I get it.
Apparition: Seriously, this is 
duuuuumb
.
