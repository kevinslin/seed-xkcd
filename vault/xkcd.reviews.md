## Transcript
Shopping before online reviews:
[[A man and a woman stand in a store. The man points at a lamp on the table in front of him. There is another lamp on the table behind them.]]
Man: This lamp is pretty.
Woman: And affordable.
Man: Let's get it.
Woman: Ok! 

Shopping now: 
[[The man points at a lamp on the table in front of him. The woman looks at her phone.]]
Man: This lamp is pretty.
Woman: It's got 1 1
2 stars on Amazon. Reviews all say to avoid that brand.

[[The man and woman are now both looking at their phones.]]
Man: This one has good reviews.
Woman: Wait, one guy says when he plugged it in, he got a metallic taste in his mouth and his cats went deaf.
Man: Eek. What about -- ...no, review points out it resembles a uterus.

[[The man is still looking at his phone, the woman has hers at her side.]]
Man: Ok, I found a Swiss lampmaker with perfect reviews. Her lamps start at 1,300 Francs and she's only reachable by ski lift. 
Woman: You know, our room looks fine in the dark.
