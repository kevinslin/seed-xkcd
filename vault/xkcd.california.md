California Droughts
Based on map data from US drought monitor
NOAA
Richard Tinker
((Scale:  Dry, moderate, severe, extreme, ludicrous (exceptional) going from yellow to orange to red to black))
((California map data showing drought from Jan 4, 2000 to Aug 14, 2014 with the state squished in between))
