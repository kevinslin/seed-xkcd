## Transcript
[[A surgeon is standing over a patient on a gurney.]]
Patient: While you're doing the surgery, can you also implant this in my arm?

Surgeon: A USB port?
Man: Just wire it up to some nerves.

Surgeon: ... This won't let your brain control USB devices, you know.
Man: Sure -- I just want the hardware.

Man: The rest is software; I'm sure there will be a project to patch together support eventually.
Surgeon: Ah -- you're a Linux user, I see.
Man: Yeah, how'd you know?
