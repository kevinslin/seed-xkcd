## Transcript
[[A man points to a diagram of a particle accelerator]]
Man 1: Do you have any thoughts regarding the particle accelerator's tertiary F.E.L. Guidance System?
Man 2: We can't put the broken part in the machine.  It wouldn't smash the right tiny things together.  Then the machine might break.  That would be very bad.
[[Text at the bottom reads "I spent all night reading simple.wikipedia.org, and now I can't stop talking like this.]]
