## Transcript
Because of a family illness, instead of regular comics, this week I'll be sharing some strips that I drew as part of a game I played with friends.  Each comic had to be written and drawn in five minutes.

    -- Randall

(( The individual comics are arranged haphazardly.  Once again they will be separated by double newlines, while panels will be separated by single newlines.))

Pearl Harbor. November 7th, 1941.
[[There is a beach, with some ships floating in a crescent shaped harbor.]]

[[The same bay, again.]]

[[The boats continue to move about the harbor.]]

[[The boats do their thing.  A title explains.]]
(We're going to be here a while, since the attack wasn't until December.)


[[A man is sittin gon a bus, a woman in front of him.]]
I know it's natural and all, but I really wish women on the bus wouldn't try to breastfeed me.
Woman: C'mon, have some milk. Right here.
Me: I'm 
reading.

[[A newspaper front page.  Billy Joel is between two policemen.]]
Times
Billy Joel Arrested for Arson


[[One person has a cord leaving their mouth, the other is holding a handset on the end of it to their ear.]]
Handset: Hee hee hee... *giggle*
I hear that if you drink coke and eat pop rocks, you vomit up a corded telepohen handset on which you hear creepy little girls giggling.


[[Three soldiers are holding a large integral sign, while a fourth points a gun at the Little Rock High School.]]
1957: Eisenhower orders the military to integrate Little Rock High School.


[[A smartphone is vibrating across a table, towards a person.]]
The smartphones got 
too
 smart... and developed a taste... for BLOOD!
Fortunately, the only way they could move was by turning on their vibrate while on a sloped table.


[[A person is reading to their child.]]
Person: And the wolf went to see the 38th little pig, who had built his house out of strontium.
Person: And the wolf was all, "Ok, what is 
with
 this shit?"
The 119 Little Pigs


[[Someone is holding up a gun.]]
Person: Fastest gun in the west!

[[The gun is galloping across the desert.]]
<<gallop>> <<gallop>>

[[There is a podium, with a gun in each position.]]
Winner!


[[A picture of a centrifuge dominates the panel.]]
Centrifuges:
They're what separate the men from the boys.


[[A computer monitor is plugged in, and cables run into a closet.]]
Lucy: Time passes differenly in Narnia, so by putting the CPU and storage for my machine there, I was able to run through the Folding@Home and Seti@Home databases in about an hour.
Peter: There are _so_ many problems with that.


[[Someone is talking to Alice.]]
Person: One of these days, Alice... Wham, zoom, sploosh, fwoom, splash, gurlle, wheeeee, fwoosh, aren't waterslides fun?!
