## Transcript
[[A figure walks on screen, holding a phone, and starts talking to black hat guy.]]
Figure: Did you get my texts? 
Black hat guy: You should install this keyboard I found. 
Figure: What? Why? Is it better than SwiftKey?
Black hat guy: In some ways. 

[[Black hat guy begins to walk off-panel.]]
Figure: Ok, installing... It's not working. The key area is blank-I can't type anything. 

[[Black hat guy has left. The figure stares at their phone.]]

[[The figure lets their hand fall to their side.]]
Figure: ... Hey.
