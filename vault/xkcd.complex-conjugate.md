![Fun fact: if you say this every time a professor does something to a complex-number equation that drops the imaginary part, they'll eventually move the class to another room and tell everyone else except you.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/complex_conjugate.png)

## Transcript
[[A teacher is standing at a whiteboard covered in equations.]]
Teacher: Okay, anyone who's feeling like they can't handle the physics here should probably just leave now.

Teacher: Because I'm multiplying the wavefunction by its complex conjugate.
Teacher: That's right.

[[Dramatic zoom.  It appears the teacher is writing on the side of the panel.]]
Teacher: Shit just got 
real
