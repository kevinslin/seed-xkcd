## Transcript
A man stands at a blackboard covered in equations and diagrams, an open laptop and scattered paper at his feet. His fists are balled in anger and there is a little angry squiggle over his head. A second man stands behind him, arms out in a shrug.
((Words in <> are gray.))
Second man: You're trying to predict the behavior of <complicated system>? Just model it as a <simple object>, and then add some secondary terms to account for <complications I just thought of>. -- Easy, right? -- So, why does <your field> need a whole journal, anyway?
Liberal-arts majors may be annoying sometimes, but there's 
nothing
 more obnoxious than a physicist first encountering a new subject.
