## Transcript
[[A person shows up at a boat docked at the edge of a river.  The person has brought along a head of cabbage, a goat, and a wolf.]]
Problem: The boat only holds two, but you can't leave the goat with the cabbage or the wolf with the goat.

[[The wolf looks curiously at the lumpy bally that's been left behind while the person goes off with the goat]]
Solution: 1. Take the goat across

[[The goat remains tied up on the far side.  The wolf watches the person come back]]
2. Return alone.

[[The wolf thinks "aww no mo bally" as the person goes off]]
3. Take the cabbage across. 

4. Leave the wolf.  Why did you have a wolf?
[[The wolf goes off all sad-like]]
