## Transcript
[[ We're looking at a comment thread.]]
Person 1: This video looks fake to me.
Person 2: Woosh
Person 1: Huh? Everyone's acting like it's real! 
Person 1: If it's a joke lots of people aren't getting it.
Person 1: What am I missing?!!
Person 1: Answer me

{{Title text: It also occasionally replies with 'Comment of the year', 'Are you for real', and 'I'm taking a screenshot so I can remember this moment forever'.}}
