## Transcript
[[We see a screenshot of SkiFree, with the abominable snowman running towards the player]]

[[A girl is sitting at her computer.]]
Girl: (thinking) I've always thought of the SkiFree monster as a metaphor for the inevitability of death.

[[Her friend comes up behind her.]]
Friend: SkiFree, huh? You know, you can press "F" to go faster than the monster and escape.

[[The screenshot again. The player is zooming away from the monster.]]

[[The girl sits at her computer in silence.]]

{{Title text: And from that day on, I wore this little 'F' key pendant everywhere I went.}}
