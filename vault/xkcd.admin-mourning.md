![And every day it gets harder to fight the urge to su to the user and freak people out.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/admin_mourning.png)

## Transcript
[[The text is over a white-on-black terminal showing a bit of output from ps -el, with processes running from root and sam.]]
When a user dies, their connections time out,
but their screen sessions linger.

[[The end of the command line is a |grep sam.]]
The server's uptime grows
because you can't bring yourself to reboot

and wipe out
their last earthly presence

[[The processes listed are screen, zsh, irssi, and grep sam.]]
the ghost in zshell.
