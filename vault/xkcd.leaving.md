## Transcript
[[A man looks down at a puddle on the floor and speaks to someone out-of-panel.]]
Man: Hey, while you're out, can you pick up some spray cleaner that works on cat vomit?
Voice: Can do! -- Bye!

[[Man extends his arm and faces the leaving person.]]
Man: ...Wait!
Voice: Yes?
Man: Uh. ...You are in my heart always.
Voice: ...?

Sometimes, when people leave, I'm seized by a sudden fear that they'll die while they're out, and I'll never forget the last thing I said to them.
