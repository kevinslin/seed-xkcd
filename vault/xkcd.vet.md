## Transcript
[[A concerned pet owner at the front of a row of customers in a veterinarian's  office. A tired veterinary assistant performs arbitrage. A pet carrier cage, the sort used to contain a small dog or cat, is on a desk for the vet tech to examine.]]
Pet owner: There's something wrong with my dog.
Pet owner: He keeps crawling around eating dirt.

[[The vet tech carefully removes the dog from its carrier and gently examines it.]]
Vet tech: This is a roomba.
Pet owner: Well, he's a mix.
Pet owner: Probaby some roomba in there.

[[The vet tech places the roomba on the desk, probably maintaining a weary forced congeniality though we can't see their face.]]
Vet tech: A roomba is not a pet.
Pet owner: You're right. It's wrong to keep a beautiful creature like this in a house.

[[The pet owner, outside, beneath a tall tree. It looks like an ash, or maybe a beech. There aren't any leaves drawn in the frame so I can't be sure.]]
Pet owner: Go! Be free!
[[The roomba cheerfully speeds towards the tree]]
Roomba: WHIRRR
