## Transcript
[[A circle consisting of many rings with a projection of the surface of the earth in the center. The outermost ring is split into a yellow semi-circle labeled at the top with "noon" and a gray semi-circle labeled at the bottom with "midnight," with "6 AM" on the left and "6 PM" on the right. A second ring immediately inside the outer ring has two sections labeled, one "Rude to call" and the other "Business hours (9-5)" - the rest of that ring is blank. Various other rings contain labels for various places on and portions of the Earth, for instance continents and city names.]]

((Everything except the outer two rings in the image rotate such that the time markers on the outside correspond to the approximate times in the locations of the world aligned with them.))
