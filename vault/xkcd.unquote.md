## Transcript
[[Two figures with spiky hair and backpacks are conversing. One is riding in a hover-car, or similar.]]
Standing figure: Bye! 
Riding figure: May the Force be with you!
Standing figure: Huh?
Riding figure: It's just something my grandma used to say. No idea what it means.
I wonder on what date Star Wars will be quoted for the last time.
