![And the journal is filled with all the things I'd say to her if I were nice like you.  I burn it when it's full.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/journal.png)

## Transcript
[[Man picks up book from a table]]
Man: Since when do you keep a journal?
[[Man in black hat leans over from computer to answer]]
Man in black hat: Oh, I pretend to write in it on the train, and wait for a shy-looking girl to sit across from me.
[[Scene change to a train. The man in black hat is sitting across from a girl]]
Main in black hat (narrating): I glance up and wait for her to make eye contact, then look down bashfully and, if I can, blush.
[[Scene back to original room with man and man in black hat]]
Man in black hat: Then, when I see her start to smile at me, I roll my eyes and hit her with a quick glare, then resume writing.  The alienation stays with her all day.  It's great.
[[Man in black hat is back to typing on the computer]]
Man: You're sickening.  This is why we can't have nice people
Man in black hat: I can't help it. It's like shooting lonely, angsty fish in a barrel.
