## Transcript
[[Two figures approach a table]]
Figure 1: Hey, what's up?
Figure 2: Shhhhh.
Figure 1: Hrm?
Figure 2: There's a microSD card on your table.

[[A microSD card sits next to an assortment of coins for size reference.]]
Figure 1 (out of panel): So?
Figure 2 (out of panel): I dunno, high storage densities freak me out. A whole aisle of library shelves on something smaller than a dime.

[[The two figures stand near the table, the second figure peering at the coins and card on the table.]]
Figure 2: Libraries are unnerving enough--millions of ideas surrounding you, towering over you. These cards fill me with that same reverence, that same intimidation.

[[The first figure stands alone]]
Figure 2 (out of panel): ...that same faint arousal. Maybe I'll just touch it.
Figure 1: If you lose that card I'm _NOT_ helping you find it.
