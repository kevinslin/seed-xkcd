Our Neighborhood

A portrait of all habitable-zone planets within 60 light-years of Earth (constructed from statistical data on typical planet sizes and orbits).

[[A key shows that reddish circles indicate planets which are orbiting sun-like stars, while greyish circles indicate planets around other stars. The darkest reds and greys indicate Earth-sized planets, while other more faded versions indicate sizes farther away from Earth's.]]
