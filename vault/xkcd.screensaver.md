## Transcript
I've been staring at the screen every night for twenty years, and it finally happened. 

[[A star field.]]

[[The same star field, but there's a larger white dot glowing in the middle.]]

[[The same star field, but that larger white dot's looking bigger now. Oh. It's clearly a star.]]

[[The screen is filled with white. It's coming straight for us.]]

[[The screen is filled with static.]]
Signal lost
