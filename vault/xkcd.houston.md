## Transcript
[[A spacecraft floats in outer space, the earth far in the background. Bits of it have broken off.]]
Orbiter transmission: Houston, we have a problem

[[A figure with a headset sits at a computer desk with two monitors.
Figure: Cool.

[[We see a close-up of the figure.]]
Orbiter transmission: ... What? Houston, we stirred our O2 tank and it exploded!
Figure: Sounds like you suck at stirring.

[[We see the orbiter in space, far from the planet.]]
Orbiter transmission: ... Houston? Are you-
Figure: Listen, I've got another call. Good luck landing your airplane or whatever.
