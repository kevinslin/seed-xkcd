## Transcript
[[White Beret approaches Stick Man, who is at his computer desk.]]
WB: Sweet! I finally got my subduction license!
SM: Your what?

[[White Beret leans forward on one foot and balls up his fists with effort.]]
SM: ...what are you doing?

[[White Beret leans further forward, getting closer to the desk. His feet are now buried and tiny mountains are forming on the floor and under the desk. Stick man tries to keep his computer from toppling over.]]
SM: STOP IT! STOP IT!

[[White Beret is buried up to his waist now, and the little mountains are a full-on miniature mountain range, knocking over the desk and Stick Man with it.]]
SM: AUGH!
