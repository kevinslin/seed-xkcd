## Transcript
[[The first panel is a UPS InfoNotice(r).  Most of the text on it is just scribbles, though the company logo and header is clear.]]

[[A person opens their door to see the InfoNotice(r).  From off panel, a second person reacts.]]
Person:  
What!
  I've been here all day!
Off-panel person 2: Huh?
Person: They have my laptop.

[[Now both people are visible.  The first is making an expansive gesture of annoyance.]]
Person 2: So get it tomorrow.
Person: I fly out in the morning and they don't open till noon!
Person 2: Sucks.

[[The first person is at a laptop.  The second is once again off-panel.]]
Person: It's 
right there
.  I can see the UPS building on the map.
Off-panel person 2: Ok...

[[Dramatic zoom to the person's upper torso and face, along with clenched fist.]]
Person: My laptop is there.  It's 
mine
.
Person: I'm going to get it.

[[Even more dramatic zoom!  The person's featureless face fills the panel.]]
Off-panel person 2: They won't let you.
Person: Who are they to keep from me what is mine?
Off-panel person 2: Dude, they --

[[The person spins, raising a finger, most likely to indicate some sort of quest at hand.]]
Person: A quest is at hand!
Off-panel person 2: Security's gonna throw you out.
Person: I fear neither death nor pain.  But I will not go unarmed.

((Three inset panels overlap, in a montage format.  The person narrates.))
[[Elves in long robes stand around a table, on which lies a broken sword.]]
Narrating person: Light the beacons and send word to the Elves.  They must reforge the sword of my fathers.

[[An Elf beats the sword together on an anvil.]]

[[An Elf rides a horse, silhouetted by the full moon.]]
Narrating person: Ere dawn, I will go forth to the Sorting Depot.

((The montage ends and normal panels resume.))
[[The Elf knocks at the door, sword in scabbard held under arm.]]
<<Knock knock knock knock>>

[[The person opens the door, to find a second InfoNotice(r) stuck on top of the first.  The Elf is gone.]]
