## Transcript
Imagine you were transported to an alternate universe just like your own, except people occasionally ate spiders. 
You can't convince anyone this is weird. 
[[Two figures stand. A woman is holding a big spider. The other figure looks shocked. There is another spider on the floor.]]
Woman: Mmm...
Figure: No! What are you *doing*!?
This is how I feel about lobster.
