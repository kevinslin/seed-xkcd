## Transcript
[[Three people in an elevator, one reading a posted sign.]]
Reading guy: It says here that the elevator inspection certificate is on file in the building office.
Middle guy: Whoa, cool! Let's go look at it!
Excited girl: That sounds fun!

Industry tip: Building owners know this never happens. Those signs mark elevators which have never been inspected.
