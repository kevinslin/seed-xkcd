## Transcript
[[A woman sits at a desk with a laptop.]]
Woman: Aaaa! I'm so bad at estimating how long projects will take.

[[A second woman walks on panel.]]
Woman 2: Don't panic - there's a simple trick for that: take your most realistic estimate, then double it. 
Woman: Okay, but: 

Woman 2: Now double it again. Add five minutes. Double it a third time. 
Woman: Okay...

[[The second figure has her arms in the air. The first runs around screaming.]]
Woman 2: 30 seconds have gone by and you've done nothing but double imaginary numbers! You're making no progress and will never finish! 
Woman: Aaaaaa!
Woman 2: Paaaniiic!
Woman: Aaaaaaa!
