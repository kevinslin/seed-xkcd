## Transcript
[[A man in a lab coat is talking to a woman who's sitting on an examining table.]]
Man: Well, until the second trimester, the baby hasn't decided which opening it will exit through.
Woman: *What?*
Man: We'll hope for one of the lower ones, so it won't be fighting gravity.

Did you know you can just BUY lab coats?
