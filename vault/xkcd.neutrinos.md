![I can't speak to the paper's scientific merits, but it's really cool how on page 10 you can see that their reference GPS beacon is sensitive enough to pick up continential drift under the detector (interrupted halfway through by an earthquake).](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/neutrinos.png)

## Transcript
[[Two people are talking.]]
Person 1: Did you see the neutrino speed of light thing?
Person 2: Yup! Good news; I need the cash.
Person 1: Huh? Cash?

((Text above half-sized panel.))
Yeah. When there's a news story about a study overturning all of physics, i used to urge caution, remind people that experts aren't all stupid, and end up in pointless arguments about Galileo.

((Half-height panel.))
[[Man sitting on chair, looking down at laptop in his lap. Books and things are on a desk in front of him.]]
Man: No, this isn't 
about
 whether relativity exists. If it didn't, your GPS wouldn't work. -- What do you mean, "science thought police"? Have you seen our budget? We couldn't 
begin
 to afford our own thought police.

[[Two talking people again.]]
Person 1: That sounds miserable and unfulfilling.
Person 2: Yup. So I gave up, and now I just find excited believers and bet them $200 each that the new result won't pan out.

[[Same as last panel.]]
Person 1: That's mean.
Person 2: It provides a good income, and if I'm ever wrong, I'll be too excited about the new physics to notice the loss.
