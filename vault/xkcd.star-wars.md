Hair'd character: On may 13th, the phantom menace will have come out closer to return of the jedi than to the present
Bald character: Wow.

Bald character: It's weird how I'm constantly surprised by the passage of time when it's literally the most predictable thing in the universe.
Hair'd character (gazing into distance): You know, "a long time ago" should have "plus four more decades" added in rereleases.
