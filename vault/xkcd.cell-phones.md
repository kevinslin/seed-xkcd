## Transcript
[[A person is holding a cellphone.  The black hat guy is sitting at a desk with a laptop.]]
Person: Another huge study found no evidence that cell phones cause cancer.  What was the W.H.O. thinking?
Black Hat Guy: I think they just got it backward.

[[The black hat guy swivels in his chair, holding the laptop by the upper edge of the screen.]]
Person: Huh?
Black Hat Guy: Well, take a look.

[[There is a plot of total cancer incidence and cell phone users.  Cancer rises from 1970 to 1990, then stays relatively steady.  Cell phone use rises from 1980 to the present.]]

Person: You're not... There are 
so
 many problems with that.
Black Hat Guy: Just to be safe, until I see more data I'm going to assume cancer causes cell phones.
