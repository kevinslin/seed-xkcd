## Transcript
Team Member 1 (out of panel): Wow, this is a much better design.
Team Member 2 (out of panel): Let's build it.
[[A blue print depicting a robot design for the FIRST competition. It consists of a standard mobile platform, with a pusher blade at the front. Additional parts include an umbrella on top and a trailer unit consisting a telescoping pole with a matchbox and match on top.]]

Referee (out of panel): Go!
<<CLICK>>
[[A FIRST competition field, with teams at opposite ends. Various robots appear on the field, and the team whose design appears above activates their robot.]]

[[The robot's trailer unit detaches as the telescoping pole begins to extend, and the mobile platform with umbrella rolls forward.]]
<<VRRR>>
<<CLICK>>

[[The mobile platform stops moving.]]

[[The umbrella deploys, extending beyond the dimensions of the mobile platform.]]
<<FWOOMP>>

[[The match box and match are lit beneath the sprinkler head.]]
<<FWOOSH>>

[[The heat from the match triggers the sprinkler's valve, and water sprays out of the sprinkler into the room below.]]

[[Water pours from the sprinkler onto the competition field, causing the electrical components of the opposing team's robotics platform to short and malfunction. The opposing team appears distressed and confused.]]
<<FZZZT>>
<<BWooooooo!!!>>

[[The initial robot, still protected by its umbrella, pushes along the balls toward the goal zone without any difficulty.]]
