## Transcript
((This comic was written by Jeph Jacques, and follows the vertical panel style typical of Questionable Content.  The art is more in the xkcd style, with stick figures.))
[[A girl is sitting on a bench, reading a book.  There is a tree.  Far away, a guy has a backpack on.]]
Guy's thought bubble: There she is. The most beautiful girl you've ever seen.

[[The focus is on the girl on the bench.]]
Guy's thought bubble: Every day you take this route to class, she's sitting on that bench, reading.

[[It goes even closer to her face.]]
Guy's thought bubble: You'd introduce yourself, but you wouldn't know what to say. Besides, she's way out of your league.

[[Back to the full panel.]]
Guy's thought bubble: What chance could an average guy like you have with such a radiant -
Girl's thought bubble: Hey.

[[The girl looks up at her thought bubble with a question over her head.]]
Guy's thought bubble: E-Excuse me?
Girl's thought bubble: I said hey.  You come by here a lot.

[[The girl looks over at the guy, who is scratching his head at his thought bubble.]]
Guy's thought bubble: Oh, uh, yeah.  On the way to class.
Girl's thought bubble: Wanna skip class and go get a coffee?

[[The guy is pondering what's happening.]]
Guy's thought bubble: Sure, I'd - I'd like that a lot.
Girl's thought bubble: Great, let's ditch these losers.
Girl: Hey!

[[The thought bubbles are behind the guy now, moving away.]]
Guy's thought bubble: Man, I gotta tell you, I'm SICK of being that guy's internal monologue! So whiny!
Girl's thought bubble: Seriously! I swear, he and Little Miss Daddy Issues over there were _made_ for each other.

[[The two look at each other silently.]]
