## Transcript
Thinking of buying from audible.com or iTunes?
Remember, if you pirate something, it's yours for life.  You can take it anywhere and it will always work.
[[There is a flowchart whose paths are (You're a Criminal)<-Pirate<-(Buy or Pirate)->Buy->(Things Change)->(You Try to Recover Your Collection)->(You're a Criminal)]]
But if you buy DRM-locked media, and you ever switch operating systems or new technology comes along, your collection could be lost.
And if you try to keep it, you'll be a criminal (DMCA 1201).
So remember: if you want a collection you can count on, PIRATE IT.
Hey, you'll be a criminal either way.
(If you don't like this, demand DRM-free files)
