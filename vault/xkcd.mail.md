## Transcript
[[A person is talking to someone over the phone.]]
Phone: Do you think I could mail a running chainsaw to someone?
Person: I doubt it.
Phone: What about a baby's first word?
Person: Look, your obsession with sending strange things through the mail is getting out of hand.
Phone: Can you mail a blank stare?
Phone: A dizzying height?
Phone: Pi?
Person: . . .
Phone: Well, did you at least get that package of time I sent you?
Person: I . . . you . . . no, I didn't.
Phone: Well, there was a lot of it, so it will probably take a while.
