[[Three figures are gathered around a large computer console. Seated at the console is a figure with long hair tied in a ponytail, standing behind them are a figure with medium length dark hair and one with no distinguishing features.]]
Dark-haired figure: The gravitational wave detector works! For the first time, we can listen in on the signals carried by ripples in the fabric of space itself!

[[The view has panned out a bit, nothing has changed except more cables running from the back of the console leading offscreen are visible.]]
((The following text is implied to be visible on the screen of the console.))
Event: Black hole merger in Carina (30 solar masses, 30 solar masses)

Event: Black hole merger in Orion (20 solar masses, 50 solar masses)
Event: Mortgage offer from traingulum galaxy
Event: Zorlax the Mighty would like to connect on LinkedIn

{{Title text: "That last LinkedIn request set a new record for the most energetic physical event ever observed. Maybe we should respond." "Nah."}}
