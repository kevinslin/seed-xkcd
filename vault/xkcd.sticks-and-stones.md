## Transcript
Child: Did you hear what he said about me!?
Parent: Well, remember: sticks and stones may break my bones, but words--

Child: Can make someone else feel happy or sad, which is literally the only thing that matters in this stupid world?

[[Beat.]]

Child: Right?
Parent: The world isn't *that* bad.
Child: Explain the line about sticks and stones?
Parent: ... OK, maybe it's kind of horrific.
