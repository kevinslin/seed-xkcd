## Transcript
[[A ferret with airplane wings on it]]
Friend: Why on earth did you make those wings? You don't seriously think they could let your ferret fly, right?
Guy: I... of course not.
Guy: That would be pretty dumb. It's just, uh... ...a Halloween costume.
Friend: oh, okay.
Friend: Besides, who would want a pet to fly anyway?
Guy: Yeah. Pretty lame, huh?
Friend: Anyway, let's go play video games.
[[Friend leaves]]
[[Friend is gone, and Guy is looking at ferret]]
[[Guy imagines ferret flying over the ocean near the beach using his makeshift wings]]
