## Transcript
[[A man sits hugging his knees.]]
Man: If only there were some way we could be together.
((He fades into a thought bubble containing the next four panels.))

[[A man and woman are in a bed together.  The man is rubbing the woman's shoulders.]]
Woman: We're so lucky to have each other. How did it happen, anyway?
Man: I, uh... I don't remember.

Woman: No, really, how did we get together? It's hard to imagine it happening.
Man: It does strain the bounds of fantasy...
Woman: ... Fantasy? That's it!

Woman: My God, it's the only explanation: We're objects in some transient fantasy. We'll be gone when it ends!
Man: We'll lose each other.
Woman: Oh God.

[[They leap from the bed.  The woman has a flaming torch.]]
Woman: Well, I'm not going out quietly. I'm burning this fucking world.
Man: Burn the world!
Woman: Fire! Fire! Cleanse this hellish place --
((The thought ends.))

[[The man is puzzled.  What happened?]]
