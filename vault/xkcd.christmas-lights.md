## Transcript
[[Three figures sit around a large spectrum histogram, which has a general upward trend towards the infrared portion of the spectrum as well as a spike in that portion. To the right of the figures is a triangular shape approximating that of a Christmas tree made out of smaller spectrum histograms, each with spikes in places corresponding to the red or green sections of the visible spectrum. At the top is a final spectrum of whiter light.]]
