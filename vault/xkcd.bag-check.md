## Transcript
[[A man and woman are at a security checkpoint in an airport. A guard is holding an open backpack and a bottle of water, and the man is arguing with him.]]
Man: But if you're worried about bombs, why are you letting me keep my laptop batteries? If I overvolted them and breached the cells, it would make a sizeable explosion.
Woman: Oh god.
Man: It's okay, dear. In a moment he'll realize I have a good point and return my water.
