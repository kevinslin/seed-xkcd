## Transcript
[[Two figures in winter hats, one hat white and the other hat black, are walking.]]
White Hat: It is brutal out. So much for global warming, huh?
<<Black Hat sighs>>
Black Hat: This used to happen all the time.
White Hat: What?

[[A picture of an x-y plot, with years from 1970 to 2014 along the x-axis and dots rising up for each year, mostly concentrated from 1970 to 1999. The plot is labeled "Days with lows < 0°F".]]
Black Hat: You're from St. Louis, right? On average, it used to get below 0°F there a handful of days per year. But you haven't had a day like that since the nineties.

[[The two figures continue walking.]]
Black Hat: Then, in 2014, when the first polar vortex hit, it dipped below zero for two days. And everyone freaked out because what used to be normal now feels too cold.
White Hat: It is too cold!

[[Panel labeled "The future:" contains a generic figure, looking at a frozen puddle on the ground.]]
Figure: Look at this - ice! In St. Louis! So much for global warming.
<<off-panel sigh>>
