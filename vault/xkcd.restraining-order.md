## Transcript
[[Man and woman stand facing one another. Both hold sheets of paper.]]
Text reads: Not content with normal restraining orders, my ex got creative.
Man: Wait... I can't get closer than 500 yards of you... or more than 600 yards away?
Woman: You'll have to move somewhere within this ring.
