![My MRI research shows a clear correlation between the size of the parietal lobe--the part of the brain that handles spatial reasoning--and enjoyment of 3D Doritos®.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/hardware_reductionism.png)

## Transcript
[[Two people talk to each other while holding their smartphones.]]
1: Your photos from the triathlon got so many more likes than mine. 
2: Yeah - my phone is quad-core. Research shows that iPhones like yours have just two cores, so they have a hard time capturing scenes with three different events in them.

If we talked about phone hardware the way we talk about brain hardware.
