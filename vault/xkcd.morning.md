## Transcript
[[Girl standing to one side]]
We've all seen The Matrix
We've all joked about "What resolution is life?"
But it doesn't blunt the shock
Of waking up one morning
[[Girl looks up from field and sees several colored pixels in the sky]]
And seeing dead pixels in the sky.
{{Title Text: I'd press on them to try to unstick them, but I can't reach.  Can we try cycling day and night really fast?}}
