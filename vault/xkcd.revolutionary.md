![I mean, what's more likely -- that I have uncovered fundamental flaws in this field that no one in it has ever thought about, or that I need to read a little more?  Hint: it's the one that involves less work.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/revolutionary.png)

## Transcript
Person: Yes, science is an open process in which a good idea can come from anybody.

Person: Yes, widely-believed theories are 
on occasion
 overturned by simple thought experiments.

Person: And yes, your philosophy degree equips you to ask interesting questions sometimes.

[[The person is talking to a philosopher with a goatee, who is sitting at a computer.]]
Person: But you did not just overturn special relativity, a subject you learned about an hour ago, with your "racecar on a train" idea.
Philosopher: You just don't like that I'm turning a rational eye to your dogma. Hey, what's the email for the president of physics?
