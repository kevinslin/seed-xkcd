## Transcript
[[Scientist and commander are on a space station.]]
Scientist: Commander! Come quick!
Scientist: It's the nanobots--they've STOPPED!

Scientist: They devoured 40% of the Earth, and then just ... quit! They're just sitting there!
Scientist: Why?!

Commander: It's a mystery. ... unless ... What's the volume of each nanobot?
Scientist: A few cubic microns. Why?
Commander: I think the year 1998 just bought us some time.

[[Earth's surface, covered in mountains of nanobots.]]
In the swarm:
Nanobot: What do you mean, "Run out of addresses?"
Other Nanobot: Look, we should've migrated away from IPv6 AGES ago ...
