![This exotic blade was wrought from a different fallen star. The meteorite was a carbonaceous chondrite, so it's basically a lump of gravel glued into the shape of a sword. A SPACE sword!](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/metallurgy.png)

## Transcript
[[A man and a woman stand at the counter of a shop. A man with a beard and a beret stands behind the counter, holding a sword.]]
Beard: This sword was forged from a fallen star. Antimony impurities make the blade surprisingly 
brittle
 and 
weak
. 

[[A close-up on the man with the beard.]]
Beard: And 
this
 dagger is made of metal from a far-off kingdom. It glows blue.
Out of panel: When orcs are near?

[[The man with the beard holds a dagger.]]
Beard: No, always. Radiation from the Actinum content. 
Woman: ...does it have eldritch powers?

[[The bearded man puts the dagger back behind the counter.]]
Beard: It gives the wielder +2 to cancer risk.
Other Man: I think we should find another shop.
