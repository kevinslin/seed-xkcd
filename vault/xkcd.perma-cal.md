![The flood of PermaCalNTP leap-second notifications was bad enough, but when people started asking for millisecond resolution, the resulting DDOS brought down the internet.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/permacal.png)

## Transcript
[[Two figures converse]]
First: What day is it?
Second: Sunday the nineteenth.
First: But you said it was the nineteenth yesterday.
Second. It changed AGAIN? Crap, better add another leap day.

Caption: My new simplified calendar system assumes the date never changes, then corrects any drift via leap days.
