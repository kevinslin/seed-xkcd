## Transcript
[[A man stands by a genie, whose lower body becomes smoke and trails down to an old-fashioned lamp]]
Genie: You have awakened me from the lamp. You may have three wishes. What does your heart desire?
Man: I'd like a human-sized hamster ball.
[[A hamster ball appears; the man is inside it]]
Man: Sweet!
[[The man steps to left; the ball rolls that way]]
[[He does the same thing to his right]]
[[The man comes to rest in the centre of the panel]]
Genie: And your other wishes?
Man: Why would I need other wishes?
