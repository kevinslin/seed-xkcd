![She's a perfectly nice lady from a beautiful city, and there's no reason to be mean just because she thinks a quarterback is a river in Egypt.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/savannah_ancestry.png)

## Transcript
[[A man and woman are at a blackboard with equations and graphs on it.]]
Man: Look, I'm doing my best, but the fact is your savannah ancestors just didn't prepare you for doing abstract math.
Woman: See, that's just the kind of bullshit sexism that discredits evo-psych. Your "evolutionary histories" always seem tuned to produce 1950's gender roles.
Man: Evolutionary? What? I meant Savannah, Georgia.
Woman: ... Hey! Let's leave my mom out of this.
