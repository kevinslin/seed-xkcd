## Transcript
[[Two people are walking.  The first is wearing a white hat.]]
Second person: It just blows my mind. She seemed so genuine. I had no idea she was such a serial liar.
Second person: I just wish I had our six months back.

[[The view focuses on the second person.]]
Second person: Her exes say the same thing happened to them.
Second person: Maybe what we need is a terrible-ex tracking and notification service.


[[The second person turns, thoughtfully.]]
First person: But after all the problems with sex offender registries, who would agree to run it?
Second person: Maybe one of the state governments more willing to experiment could try it out...

Soon...
[[Two people are sitting at a table, on which sit wine glasses and plates.  One has glasses and a goatee, and the other has long hair.  A person approaches them carrying a clipboard and a license.]]
License person: Excuse me, ma'am.
Long hair person: Yes?
License person: This man is known to the state of California to be a total douchebag.
