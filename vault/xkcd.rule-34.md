## Transcript
[[A guy sits in front of his desktop computer. A girl lies belly-down on the floor in front of her laptop.]]
Male: HuhâThomas the Tank Engine slash fiction.
Female: It's rule 34 of the internet. If you can imagine it, there is porn of it. 
Male: Nah. The web is freaky, but it can't begin to have everything.
Male: There's no porn set atop storm-chasing vans. No homoerotic spelling bees. No women playing electric guitar in the shower.
Female: Actually, that last one would look pretty hot. As long as they were unplugged or waterproofed...
Female: Rivulets of water run down her chest, the smooth body of the guitar firm against her hips.
Female: She twangs the E-string and it shakes off tiny droplets in all directions.
[[She rises into a crouch]]
Female: You're sure it doesn't exist?
Male: Not yet.
Female: I'm registering WetRiffs.com. Let's get on this.
