## Transcript
[[The incredibly varied shelf of a supermarket aisle.  There are many different types of products on this shelf.  Each type has numerous different brands, all surrounding a very plain brand that has, as its only label, the type of product.  A plain bag, labeled in plain black letters, says "Potato Chips" and is surrounded by all the other various brands of potato chips.  The same exists for tissues, crackers, matches, peanuts, hot sauce, sugar , milk, pasta, coffee, black beans, lima beans, mayo, ketchup, tea, and bread.  There is a stark contrast between the incredibly noisy and complex labeling of every other brand and this simple one.]]
