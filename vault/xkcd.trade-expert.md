Anchor: (to camera) And for more on the summit, we turn to trade expert Dr. Steven Berlee. Steven?

DSB: I'm not actually a doctor or a trade expert. I'm just a programmer who lies to get on news shows.

[[Close-up on DSB.]]
Anchor: (off camera) What? Why?
DSB: To share a message with newscasters.

[[Pull back to shot of both men.]]
