## Transcript
[[A person monologues to their friend.]]
Picture a grassy field.
In the center sits a small, pale, big-eyed creature with the power to escape from any visualized scene and move freely through the brain that imagined it.
It glances around nervously and--
--whoops, where'd it go?
Sorry about that! Keep an eye out for it in your daydreams.
