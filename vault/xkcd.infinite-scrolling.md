![Maybe we should give up on the whole idea of a 'back' button. 'Show me that thing I was looking at a moment ago' might just be too complicated an idea for the modern web.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/infinite_scrolling.png)

## Transcript
[[A woman stands at a desk, reading a book, touching it very gingerly. Another figure is standing behind her.]]
Figure: Why are you turning the pages like that? 
Woman: If I touch the wrong thing, I'll lose my place and have to start over.
If books worked like infinite-scrolling webpages
