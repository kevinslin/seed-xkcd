-Fate unknown

[[Again the stick person gestures towards a board behind him which reads:]

-Colleague says he's much older than he claims.

[[An FBI sketch of Cooper appears side-by-side with a flickr photo by Al Pavangkana of Wiseau. The person is standing at the board, responding to someone in the audience, who is out of panel.]]
Audience member: This is the dumbest theory I've ever heard.
Stick figure: But it explains
