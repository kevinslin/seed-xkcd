[[Black Hat Man and another man stand in front of a double door, which bears the label 'TIME door'. BHM has his hands on his hips.]]
BHM: I finished my time machine, but it's one-use only.
Man: You 
gotta
 kill Hitler.

[[Close-up of BHM, one hand palm upward.]]
BHM: You are you so obsessed with this Hitler guy? We have 
all
 of 
time
 we could explore!

[[Close-up of the other man with both hands palm upward.]]
Man: He's evil incarnate! He murdered millions and sparked global war! 
Everyone
 agrees -- if you get a time machine, you kill Hitler.

[[BHM enters the now open Time door as the other man looks on..]]
BHM: Fine, fine, I get it! Calm down. - BRB, killing Hitler.

[[BHM returns and shuts the door, the other man has outstretched arms.]]
BHM: There. Done. Are you happy?

Thank
 you.
BHM: He was in some kind of bunker. 1945 was 
loud!
 
Man: 

NO!
