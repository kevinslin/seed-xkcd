## Transcript
[[Two men are standing at some kind of cliff edge]]
Man 1: What time is it?
Man 2: Now.
[[Full scene is revealed: the men are standing at the edge of a huge canyon in a rocky, barren landscape. A pock-marked moon and a ringed planet are visible in the burgundy-coloured sky]]
Man 1: That's a pretty boring answer.
Man 2: Is not.
Man 2: It's the least boring answer imaginable.
{{Alt text: They're standing at the lip of the canyon, which isn't clear at all.}}
