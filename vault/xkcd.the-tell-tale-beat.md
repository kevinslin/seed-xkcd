## Transcript
((The three panels show portions of a single scene. Although the characters are still stick figures, the artwork style is heavily crosshatched and shaded.))
[[In the first panel there is a desk with monitor on it, and a painting of a woman above that.  Next to it is a bookshelf.]]
Ever since I murdered Daft Punk

[[There is a fireplace, with no fire.  A rug lies before it.  At the left end of the mantelpiece are two bottles, one tall, one round.  Another photograph of a woman is in a frame at the right end.  The bookshelf continues from the previous panel.]]
And hid their bodies beneath the floorboards,
I've been haunted

[[The narrator is clutching his head and leaning forward.  A grandfather clock is behind him, next to a doorway.  Above the doorway is a pallid bust of Pallas.]]
By this *pounding*.
