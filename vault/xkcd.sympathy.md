## Transcript
[[A bereaved person and his friend are talking.]]
Bereaved: The moment my brother died, I felt a searing pain in my heart.

Right:
Friend: I'm so sorry.

Wrong:
Friend: Was it instant, or was there a speed-of-light delay?

Very Wrong:
Friend: If it was instant, with the right arrangement of moving reference frames, we could use this to send signals back in time and violate causality! How many remaining siblings do you have?
