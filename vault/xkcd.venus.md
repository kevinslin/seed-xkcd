## Transcript
[[A teacher holding a pointer stands in front of a backdrop of a lush, coastal field filled with flower and greenhouses.]]
Teacher: Venus was once temperate. It had seas and rivers, and Venusians cultivated vast fields of beautiful flowers.

[[The backdrop is now a shot of an earth-like Venus seen from space, with greenhouses flying rapidly away from it.]]
Teacher: Until their greenhouses fled the planet due to the runaway greenhouse effect.

[[A little girl is seen sitting at a desk, listening to the teacher speak.]]
Teacher: The Venusians pursued their greenhouses to Earth, settling in the Netherlands and kickstarting the Dutch floral industry. Any questions?

[[A close-up on the teacher's profile, the student is out of panel.]]
Student: Because you're retiring in a month, do you just not care what you say anymore? 
Teacher: 
WHAT?!
 I 
RIDE THE SKIES
 atop a screaming bird of truth! Also, yes, I do not.
