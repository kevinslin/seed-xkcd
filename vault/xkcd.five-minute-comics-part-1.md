## Transcript
Because of a family illness, instead of regular comics, this week I'll be sharing some strips that I drew as part of a game I played with friends. Each comic had to be written and drawn in five minutes. -- Randall

----Comic #1----
[[A man and a woman stand facing each other.]]
Man: Jupiter will make its closest approach to Earth in decades.

[[The man points behind the woman, and the woman turns around.]]
Man: In fact, here it comes now!

[[Jupiter, about the size of the characters' heads, hovers into the frame at about head-height.]]
Jupiter: Hey, guys.

[[Jupiter continues to hover through the frame as the characters watch it go.]]
Jupiter: Anyone need a gravitational slingshot?
Woman: No, I'm good.
Jupiter: Aight.

----Comic #2----
[[A man sits on a box, playing a guitar.]]
Man: ...Now I don't blame him 'cause he ran and hid, -- but the meanest thing that he ever did -- was before he left, he went and named me "Trig."

----Comic #3----
[[A man looks down a well.]]
Man: Oh God, a little girl is trapped down this well!

[[The man runs off screen.]]

[[He returns, leading a pony.]]
Man: It's okay, we got you that pony you always wanted!

[[He tries to cram the pony down the well with the aid of a large stick.]]
Man: Get... in... there... -- Ugh!

----Comic #4----
[[A man and a woman stand in a server room.]]
Man: I like to get back to nature by coming out here to the server room. -- The warmth, the whirr of the drives, the drone of the fans, the howl of the wolves...
Woman: Wolves?
Man: Yeah, we started a reintroduction program.

----Comic #5----
[[A man stands by himself in the frame.]]
Man: Yo momma's so masculine that she... oh, wait, that's your dad. -- Is your mom the lady over by the door? Aww, she looks nice!

----Comic #6----
[[A man runs toward another man who is wearing a powdered wig, holding a gun in one hand, and a flute in the other. Behind him, someone is chasing him on a motorcycle.]]
Man: Bach, activate the magic flute and teleport us home! Wagner's right behind me on his Ring Cycle!
