![The TI-86 was bad enough.  I don't know how I'd have gotten through high school if I'd had a laptop+wifi.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/brick_archway.png)

## Transcript
[[Inset: A man prepares to throw a tennis ball upward.]]
[[The man lies on the ground, underneath the titular archway, next to two halves of a brick. Dust falls from the place in the archway where the man knocked the brick from with the tennis ball. The ball, meanwhile, has rolled about a meter away.]]
"Breakout" is a stupid game.
