## Transcript
As time passed, Elaine intensified her hacking work, anonymously publishing exploit after exploit.
[[Elaine is sitting under tree, typing on a laptop.]]
To crack open proprietary hardware, she teamed up with one of the top experts in signal processing and data transferring protocols.
[[Elaine, wearing a backpack, is walking up to a door where a woman is greeting her]]
Elaine: Hi, mom.
Mrs. Roberts (Elaine's mom): Hello, dear. Did you have fun?
They were an unstoppable team.
[[Elaine is on the floor with her laptop and Mrs. Roberts is on her computer at a table]]
Elaine: I finished the CSS decryptor.
Mrs. Roberts: Good, dear. I'll send it along to Jon.
And were eventually noticed.
[[Two men in black hats arrive.  One holds a briefcase that reads RIAA and the other holds a briefcase which reads MPAA]]
RIAA man: Game's over.
MPAA man: You're coming with us.
[[Elaine stands up]] 
Elaine: Oh, are we?
[[Mrs. Roberts is still sitting at her computer, typing]]
Mrs. Roberts: Now now, Elaine -
<<shink>> [[Elaine pulls a knife out]]
<<shing>> <<shing>> [[The two men each pull a katana out of their briefcase.]]
Mrs. Roberts: Don't let them provoke you, dear.
Men: We don't want to hurt you, Ma'am.
Mrs. Roberts: Don't by silly. Record company employees can't just go into houses and slice people up.
RIAA Man: Ah, so you haven't read the DMCA.
MPAA Man: Title IV, Section 408: Authorization of Deadly Force.
[[Voice comes from off-panel]]: Hark!
[[Everyone looks surprised. Mrs. Roberts stands.]]
[[Bearded man enters, bearing two katanas.]]
Bearded man: Cease this affront to freedom, or stand and defend yourselves!
MPAA Man: Stallman!
