## Transcript
[[White Hat guy and another person are walking along.]]
WH: In 
Jurassic World
, we've used genetic engineering to invent a 
better
 Dinosaur.
OP: Tyrannosaurus is the most charismatic animal that ever lived, and you think you'll 
upstage
 it?

[[They continue to walk along.]]
WH: 
Tyrannosaurus
 was cool, but it's two decades old!
OP: I think it's a 
little
 older than that.

[[As they walk along, White Hat points up at something in front of them.]]
WH: We took 
Tyrannosaurus
 and we 
improved
 it. Made it scarier, deadlier, smarter. == Look- there it is!

[[The pair are dwarfed in comparison to the T-Rex from Dinosaur Comics.]]
