![At first I was making fun of them, but joke's on me--the deer is surprisingly ergonomic, except for the kicks.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standing.png)

## Transcript
[[One figure stands at the left side of the frame, watching a second figure chase a deer that has a laptop strapped to its back.]]
Second Figure: Humans aren't built to sit all day. This is much healthier.

My hobby: one-upping the standing desk people.
