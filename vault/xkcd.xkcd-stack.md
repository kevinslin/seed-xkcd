## Transcript
[[A box is on the wall, with a pane of glass over the contents. A hammer to break the glass is below. The contents of the box is labelled 'Glass Repair Kit'.]]

{{Title text: I keep first aid kits in those emergency lockers. Sure, it's expensive to have them installed in the wall, but at least for those ones there's no need to pay extra for safety glass.}}
