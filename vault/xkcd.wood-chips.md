## Transcript
[[Man leans on desk; Woman sits behind desk.]]
Man: Did you ever figure out those mysterious woodchips?
Woman: The ones in the hallway? No.
Man: You didn't suspect that they matched the timber used in 1861 to build the "ghost ship" Mary Celeste, prompting you to send them to a lab for analysis, the results of which raised new and stranger questions?
Woman: No, I threw them out. Why?
{{My hoaxes need to get a lot less subtle.}}
{{alt-text: You didn't run a chemical analysis against the Shroud of Turin? Man, all that work for NOTHING.}}
