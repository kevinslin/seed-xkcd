![If you're a geologist or geophysicist and you don't introduce yourself by saying your name, then gesturing downward and saying "... and I study that", I don't know what you're doing with your life.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/core.png)

## Transcript
[[A cutaway diagram of the Earth, with colored layers including a labeled outer core and inner core.]]

[[A closeup of the stylized outer core, labeled "Turbulent molten metals at 30 million PSI" with turbulence lines, and of the inner core, labeled "moon-sized iron sphere."]]

[[Person reading a book pulls legs up tight under office chair, peering downwards.]]

I freak out about fifteen minutes into reading anything about the Earth's core when I suddenly realize it's RIGHT UNDER ME.

{{Title text: If you're a geologist or geophysicist and you don't introduce yourself by saying your name, then gesturing downward and saying "... and I study that", I don't know what you're doing with your life.}}
