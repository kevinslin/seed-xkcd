## Transcript
[[Friend 2 sits at a desk with glue, chess pieces, and a chessboard while Friend 1 looks over his shoulder.]]
Friend 1: What are you doing?
Friend 2: Gluing down chess pieces.
Friend 1: Why?
Friend 2: Because there's a picture I've always wanted... I'll need your coat to sneak this onto the ride.
[[A photograph of a roller coaster ride with Friend 2 sitting in the first car, chin in the hand, thinking over the chessboard. The photograph has "Mega Coaster 3000 souvenir photo" written on the margin.]]
