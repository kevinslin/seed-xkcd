## Transcript
[[Man 1 talks to man 2 who is lying down on the floor, using his laptop.]]
Man 1: You're not on the neighbour's WiFi, are you?
Man 2: Yeah, why?
Man 1: The admin... plays games.
Man 2: No problem. I'll just hop on a secure VPN.
Man 2: Whoa, my connections are dying as soon as I start to tunnel anything!
Message on laptop: A VPN? How cute! And stop trying to SSH.
Man 2: Holy shit! Someone's inserting notes into the pages I request! Editing the TCP stream live!
Man 2: Nobody's that fast. Who is this admin?
[[Neighbour (Mrs. Roberts) with bun tray in one hand, with oven mitts on both hands typing on a desktop computer.]]
Mrs. Roberts: My goodness. Neighbourhood scamps on the wireless.
<<taptaptaptap>>
Man 1: I should have warned you about Mrs. Roberts.
Man 2: How does she type with oven mitts!?
Man 1: You've been pwned pretty hard, man. You might want to sit down.
