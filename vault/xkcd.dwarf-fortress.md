![I may be the kind of person who wastes a year implementing a Turing-complete computer in Dwarf Fortress, but that makes you the kind of person who wastes ten more getting that computer to run Minecraft.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/dwarf_fortress.png)

## Transcript
[[A figure sits at a desk with a computer, hands on the keyboard, talking to an unseen observer.]]
Figure: If the corporate surveillance state monitors and controls every aspect of my life...
Big Brother: We do.
Figure: And I play Dwarf Fortress all day...
Big Brother: You do. 
Figure: Then you're effectively Dwarf Fortress players watching your dwarves play Dwarf Fortress. 
Big Brother: ... Oh God. 
Big Brother realises he's trapped in the most tedious possible Hell.
