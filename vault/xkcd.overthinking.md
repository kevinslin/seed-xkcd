## Transcript
[[A person and White Hat Guy walk along]]
Person 1: I found a study* that said water is good for you, but you should just drink it when you feel thirsty, and not go overboard.
White Hat Guy: Uh huh?
{{Footnote*: DOI:10.1097

Person 1: Another study* found that prolonged sitting isn't necessarily bad for you, as long as you're also getting exercise.
White Hat Guy: Okay...

Person 1:Now a study* claims that humans in pre-industrial societies stay up late, and sleep 6 or 7 horus a night, just like most people today.
White Hat Guy: Huh. So what you're saying is..

Person 1: Maybe we're overthinking it.
White Hat Guy: But what caused our modern epidemic of overthinking?! Plumbing? Or is it email?
Person 1: Modern? I bet the wheel was invented by someone overthinking "pushing".
