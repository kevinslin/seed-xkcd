## Transcript
[[There is a group of people.  Three women and four men.  They are standing around a table with a drink on it.]]
Man #3: Have you seen John lately?

Woman #3: He and Claire blew off this party to see Jeff.
Man #4: They do that a lot.

Man #1: Yeah; I don't know what his problem is with hanging out lately.
Man #3: He's like Katie - ever noticed how she only goes somewhere if Jeff's there?

Somebody: It's so lame how s he hangs around him even when he's not single:
Somebody: HE LIKES IT. 
Somebody: SOMEONE SERIOUSLY NEEDS TO DATE HER.
Somebody: TOTALLY.
Somebody: And honestly I feel like a jerk but I wouldn't mind if she hung around with us a little less. She needs other friends, you know!
[[Man #2 is cringing away from all the text; none of the word is attributed to specific people.]]

[[Man #2 peels a hole in the panel.  The numbers '1', '2', and '3' are visible through the gap.]]
Somebody: HAVE YOU 
NOTICED
 HOW EVERY DUDE SHE DATES IS A TOTAL DRUGGIE?
Somebody: I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought that was weird.
Somebody: Michelle dates potheads like Elaine but at least they both have real jobs.

  2 3   5   7        11    13
[[The man grabs and squeezes the 2, so it is half as wide and twice as tall.]]

[[A formula: \Sum_{i=1}^{\infty}{1
P_i} = h]]
[[ie. The sum from 1 to infinity of the inverse of each prime.]]
[[The panel shows a 2 that is 2 units tall and 1
2 wide, a 3 that is 3 units tall and 1
3 wide, and so on.  The man is moving the 7.]]

[[Man #2 writes h = infinity.  The numbers are piled on their side next to a scale.]]
Voice: Don't you agree?
Voice: Hey, wake up.

Man #1: You zoned out or something.
Man #2: Sorry; I must be... tired.

Man #1: I don't blame you. All day cooped up working on papers.
Man #3: Must be nice to get out and relax, huh?
Man #2: Yeah.
[[Girl #3 reaches for the glass on the table.]]
