Narrator: Dear various parents, grandparents, co-workers, and other "not computer people."
Narrator: We don't magically know how to do everything in every program. When we help you' we're usually just doing this:

[[I can't find one - go to 2]]

{{2. Diamond}} Pick one at random. 
[[I've tried them all - go to 4]] 
[[Ok - go to 3]]

[[No - go to 6]]

{{6. Diamond}} Have you been trying this for over half an hour?
[[Yes - go to 7]]

[[End of flowchart]]
