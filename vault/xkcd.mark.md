## Transcript
[[An adult and a child are talking.]]
Child: What's that on your arm?
Adult: The mark of a secret society.

Child: If it's secret, why tell me --
Adult: Because I know nothing.  I can't betray them because I don't know who they 
are.
  I was chosen by an agent 20 years ago.  That was my first and last direct contact.  It's safer that way.

Narration: Six years later I found a piece of paper in the street with an address on it.  The next day I found a can of kerosene in my garage that I'm sure I never bought.
[[The panel represents these actions by highlighting the mentioned objects in a world of gray.]]

Narration: I didn't know whose house it was.  I just knew that I'd been given my orders.  And I carried them out.
[[A dark figure is silhouetted against a flame.]]

Adult: I don't know who or what we're fighting.  
Adult: Maybe we're the bad guys.  
Adult: It doesn't matter to me.

Adult: It's enough to know that there are forces working beneath the chaos of life, and I'm a 
part
 of them.

Adult: That whatever this "pen fifteen" club is,  
Adult: I'm 
in
 it.
