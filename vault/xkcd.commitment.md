## Transcript
[[Guy proposing to girl on his knee]]
Narrator: I understand now. There's no choir of angels when you meet the right person. It's about growing out of your fears to realize what you have is what you want.
Guy: I do.
Girl: I do.
[[A cloud with trumpeting angels appears]]
Girl 2: Hi.
Narrator: Well, shit.
{{Could be worse. The last guy in that situation fell for one of the transient trumpeting angels.}}
