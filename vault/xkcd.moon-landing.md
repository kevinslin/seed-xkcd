## Transcript
[[A man is sitting at a table with a laptop open. His hands are on the keys.]]
Man: Hah-- Neil DeGrasse Tyson has a great reply to people who doubt astronauts went to the moon.
Voice off-screen: Oh?
Man: "Atop 3,000 tons of rocket fuel, where 
else
 do you think they were headed?"

[[The voice off screen turns out to be a woman. She is depicted, and now the man is off-screen.]]
Woman: Cute. But it overlooks an even simpler argument.
Man: Which is?

[[Both the woman and man are now visible. The man has turned her chair around to face her.]]
Woman: If NASA were willing to fake great accomplishments, they'd have a second one by now.
Man: 
Ouch.

Woman: ...too mean?
Man: That burn was so harsh I think you deorbited.
