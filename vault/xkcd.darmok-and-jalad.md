## Transcript
[[Captain Dathon is seen on a communications screen]]
Alien: Darmok and Jalad at Kalenda's!

[[Jean-Luc Picard and Deanna Troi stand next to each other, looking off to the right.]]
Picard: Their language must be based on folklore and metaphor! Computer! Search cultural archives for Darmok-Jalad-Kalenda!

[[Picard and Troi listen to the response]]
Computer (off-panel): In Tamarian legend, Darmok and Jalad got totally wasted and hooked up at a party at Kalenda's.

[[Dathon is seen on the communications screen again, winking]]
<<Wiiiiiink>>
