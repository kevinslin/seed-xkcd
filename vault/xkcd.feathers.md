![Click to see a video of a modern bird using stability flapping during predatory behavior. It all fits! Also, apparently Microraptor had *four* wings? The past keeps getting cooler! (And there's more of it every day!)](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/feathers.png)

## Transcript
[[A woman approaches a little girl, who is sitting on the floor with a pile of books, once of which she is reading.]]
Woman: What are you reading about?
Girl: Dinosaurs!
Woman: Oh, yeah.

[[The woman stands talking to the little girl, who is still looking at her book.]]
Woman: They've gotten all weird since when I was a kid. They used to be awesome, but now they all have dorky feathers, right?
Girl: Yup!

[[The woman is still standing, looking at the little girl.]]
Girl: This says they now think raptors used their wings for stability, flapping to stay on top of their prey while hanging on with their hooked claws and eating it alive.
*Fowler et al., PLOS ONE 6(12), 2011

[[The woman stares at the girl, who is still reading the book.]]

[[The woman sits down on the floor with the girl and starts reading another of the books.]]
