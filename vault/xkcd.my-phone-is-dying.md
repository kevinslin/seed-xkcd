## Transcript
[[Beret guy walks up to a figure, holding his phone.]]
Beret guy: My phone's about to die.

[[They stand and look at each other. Beret Guy's phone seems a bit bigger.]]
Figure: Where'd you get a big iPhone? I didn't think they were out yet. 
Beret guy: It's my regular one. It's just dying. 

[[His phone is now the size of a tablet.]]
Beret guy: As it consumes its battery, it heats up and expands. Soon it will swell to enormous size, engulfing us both. 

[[His phone is now the size of a badger.]]
Beret guy: Then it will collapse in a violent explosion! 
Figure: ... Do you want to borrow my charger? 
Beret guy: That would only make it run out faster! 

{{Title text: When it explodes, it will cast off its outer layers, leaving behind nothing but a slowly fading PalmPilot, calculator, or two-way pager.}}
