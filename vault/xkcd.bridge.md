## Transcript
[[A teenager stands talking to a parent off-screen.]]
Parent: No, you can't go. 
Teenager: But all my friends-
Parent If all your friends jumped off a bridge, would you jump too? 
Teenager: Oh Jeez. Probably.

Parent: What!? Why!?
Teenager Because all my friends did. Think about it - which scenario is more likely: 

Teenager: Every single person I know, many of them levelheaded and afraid of heights, abruptly went crazy at exactly the same time... ... or the bridge is on fire? 

Parent: ... I, uh... hmm. 
Teenager: Imagine reading this on CNN: "Many fled their vehicles and jumped from the bridge. Those who stayed behind..." Is something good about to happen to those people? 
Parent: Maybe they'll find cookies? 
Teenager: OK, *you* stay. I'm jumping.
