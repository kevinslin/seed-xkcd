## Transcript
Man: Yes, from the evidence it looks pretty likely to me that we're causing global warming on a horrific scale.  But with science you don't need to argue.  It doesn't matter who wins the debate -- it's about reality.  By just waiting a little longer, we'll get to SEE who was right.  It feels unethical but I find myself wanting to keep quiet about the science just to know for sure.  As terrible as it sounds, the state of the world isn't really my responsibility.  I'm just thrilled to get to watch.  If the scientists are right -- and if we keep people from understanding just a little longer -- we'll enjoy quite a ride.  And pragmatically, on the outside chance that they're all wrong, I get saved the embarrassment of having spoken up.
