## Transcript
Narrator: Why is chess so hard? Maybe the answers lie within me. Maybe I just need to let go, relax, and let my instincts and subconscious speak.

Narrator's Subconscious: Knight to G-4

Narrator: That's not even a legal move.
Narrator's Subconscious: Okay, hold on. How do the pawns capture, again?
Narrator: Man, Obi-Wan was full of crap.
