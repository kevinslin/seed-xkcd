## Transcript
[[Hat Guy is holding the remote for a drone which hovers nearby.]]
Guy: What's that?
Hat Guy: It's a drone for my new business, AirAware.

Our UAVs follow you and learn your schedule. If you miss a turn, forget an appointment, or give someone inaccurate information, they alert you.
Woman, on the phone: I'll be there in five.
Drone: WRONG!
Woman: Augh!

Guy: That sounds annoying. Who would pay for that?
Hat Guy: Huh? Nobody pays. I'm just making these and releasing them.

Guy: That's not a business. You're just yelling at strangers from the sky.
Guy: A business has to make money somehow.
Drone: WRONG!
Guy: Augh!!
