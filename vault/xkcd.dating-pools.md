## Transcript
[[Woman is sitting on the ground with her elbows on her knees and her hands on her chin.  She is talking to a man.]]
Woman: This sucks. The median first marriage age is 26. The pools of singles is shrinking. I'm running our of time.
Man: Actually, not quite.
Man: Yes, older singles are rarer. But as you get older, the dateable age range gets wider. An 18-year-old's range is 16-22, whereas a 30-year-old's might be more like 22-46.
[[Man points to a chart]]
Text on chart: Standard creepiness rule: Don't date under (Age
2 + 7)
Man: I did some analysis of this with the Census Bureau numbers just last weekend. Your dating pool actually GROWS until middle age. So don't fret so much!
[[Man is pointing to new set of charts. The first chart is labeled Singles, and is a decreasing graph.  The second graph is labeled Dating Pool, and is a bell curve.]]
Woman: Did you analysis say anything about the dating prospects of people who spend weekends at home making graphs?
Man: Come on. Somewhere at the edge of the bell curve is the girl for me.
