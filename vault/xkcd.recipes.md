## Transcript
[[Three people, one woman and two men, sit along a table with dishes and drinks in front of them. A fourth man is walking in, a plate with food on it in one hand, a laptop in the other.]]

Woman: I've got... Cheerios with a shot of vermouth.
Man #1: At least it's better than the quail eggs in whipped cream from last time.
Man #2: Are these Skittles 
deep-fried?

Man #3: C'mon guys, be patient. In a few hundred more meals, the genetic algorithm should catch up to existing recipes and start to optimize.
