![They'd convince me to come out of retirement for one last job: biting into a giant lump of slightly soft wax a couple of times.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/career.png)

## Transcript
[[A figure stands facing a desk, behind which another figure is sitting in a desk chair.]]
Standing Figure: It would start with five minutes of peeling lint from dryer traps, followed by an hour of pressing a lightsaber handle against things and switching it on. Then I'd retire to a life of luxury.

When people ask me to describe my dream job, I'm never sure how realistic to be.
