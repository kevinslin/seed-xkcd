## Transcript
[[A stick figure says to another black-hat-wearing figure.]]
Man: I'm a poisson distribution!
Man: Still a poisson distribution.
Hat Guy: What the hell, man.  Why do you keep saying that?
Man: Because I'm totally a poisson distribution.
Hat Guy: I'm less than zero.
[[Man is gone; Hat Guy is whistling.]]
