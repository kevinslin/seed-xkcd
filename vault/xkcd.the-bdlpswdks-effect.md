## Transcript
[[A person with a ponytail stands in front of a projector screen with an image of a speeding firetruck hurtling toward a person on it. They hold a pointer, and indicate towards the image.]]
Ponytail: The Bernoulli-Dopper-Leidenfrost-Peltzman-Sapir-Whorf-Dunning-Kruger-Stroop Effect states that if a speeding fire truck lifts off and hurtles toward you on a layer of superheated gas, you'll dive out of the way faster if the driver screams "RED!" in a 
non
-tonal language that 
has
 a word for "firefighter" than if they scream "GREEN!" in a 
tonal
 language with 
no
 word for "firefighter" which you 
think
 you're fluent in but 
aren't.
