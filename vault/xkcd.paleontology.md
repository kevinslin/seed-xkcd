## Transcript
[[A man and a woman in a museum, near a reconstructed dinosaur fossil.]]
Woman: Man, paleontology sucks these days.
Man: Why?
Woman: Jurassic Park came out 15 years ago.
Man: So?
Woman: Today's grad students got into dinosaurs after seeing it as kids. They don't care about fossils. Brats.
[[A woman in a hat exploring a barren landscape.]]
Woman: Before they had living dinosaurs handed to them by Hollywood, I was out in Texas digging up Arcocanthosaur teeth.
Man: So, you were into dinosaurs when they were still underground?
Woman: Exactly!
