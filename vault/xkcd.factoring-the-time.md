## Transcript
[[One man is sitting at a computer.  Another man is sitting at a separate desk.  There is a clock which reads 2:53]]
Man at desk: 253 is 11x23
Man at computer: What?
Man at desk: I'm factoring the time.
Man at desk: I have nothing to do, so I'm trying to calculate the prime factors of the time each minute before it changes.
Man at desk: It was easy when I started at 1:00, but with each hour the number gets bigger
Man at desk: I wonder how long I can keep up.
[[Man at desk reaches back and touches the clock]] <<beep>> [[Clock now reads 14:53]]
Man at desk: Hey!
Man at computer: Think fast.
