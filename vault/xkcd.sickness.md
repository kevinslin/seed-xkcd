## Transcript
((The three panels are arranged diagonally, upper left to bottom right.))
[[Two people are walking past a tree.  One has a hat.]]
Hat person: So, has this sickness opened you up to looking for answers beyond science?
Person: ... no, not really.

[[The person turns to face the one with the hat.]]
Person: We've groped for comfort before the slings and arrows of fortune for millenia, and I begrudge nobody their sources of solace.  
But Science provides 
tools
.
$100 billion a year in scientific studies and medical R&D has bought us some pretty damn powerful slings and arrows of our own.
This world is amazing, and I'm going to live to experience more of it thanks to people who refused to gracefully accept the ineffability of reality.
I find my courage where I can, but I take my weapons from science.

Person: Because they 
work
, bitches.
