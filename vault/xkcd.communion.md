![The local police, growing increasingly concerned about this church, ask parishioners to take a sip of wine and then spit it back out for DNA testing. It's blood, and it matches a 1970s murder victim.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/communion.png)

## Transcript
[[A man and a woman are walking along together.]]
Man: How was Christmas? Did you go to church? 

Woman: Yup. We celebrated the birth of a child, then we ate of his flesh and blood. 

[[They keep walking.]]

Woman: *Seriously* hope we got the right child this time.
