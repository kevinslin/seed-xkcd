## Transcript
[[The Burning Bush of Exodus fame speaks to Moses, who is shielding himself with his arm, as if a great gust of wind is overtaking him.]]
Bush: I AM THAT I AM, THE *LORD* YOUR GOD AND THE GOD OF YOUR FATHERS, OF ABRAHAM, OF ISAAC, AND OF JACOB.

[[A droid comes into frame, Moses looks down at it.]]
Bush: AND THIS IS MY COUNTERPART, R2-D2.
<<BLEEP BLOOP>>
