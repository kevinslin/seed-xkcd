## Transcript
[[A figure with a shotgun runs into the scene and addresses a standing woman.]]
Figure: I'm from the future! You're being stalked by an unstoppable robotic assassin!

[[We see a close-up of the figure.]]
Figure: Of course, in a sense, we're *all* being stalked by an unstoppable robot. A robot called *time*.

[[The figure looks at a ticking clock on the wall.]]
Figure: I see it in the mirror. I see wrinkles, grey hairs. I hear its metallic footsteps in the relentless rhythm of the ticking clock. 

[[We pan back out to see both figures.]]
Figure: Anyway, uhhÂ– come with me if you want to live for a while. You'll still die eventually. We all will.
