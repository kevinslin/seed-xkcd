![I heard the general anesthesia drugs can cause amnesia, so when I woke up mid-extraction I started taking notes on my hand so I'd remember things later.

## Transcript
Guy, on phone: Hey! Know how you've been bugging me to play Minecraft for the past year? I'm game.
Girl, on phone: But you said you didn't want to "get hooked and spend days on end moving virtual cubes around while sitting motionless." What changed?

Guy, on phone: I'm having my wisdom teeth out, and I'll be useless and doped up on painkillers for the next few days, so that actually sounds like the perfect distraction.
Girl, on phone: Oh. I'll set you up on our server!

72 hours later...
[[Girl sitting at computer.]]
Girl, on phone: Hey -- starting to feel better? Enjoying the game? Let's see what you've... What the hell? Where IS everything?

Guy, offscreen: And sorted it into layers.
Girl, offscreen: ...
Guy, offscreen: I feel good about things. This is a good game.

[[Guy sitting on the floor at his laptop, bleeding from the mouth, surrounded by bloody wadded-up tissues and holding a bottle of medication.]]
Girl, on phone: ... What exactly is in the painkillers they gave you?
Guy, woozy: I can't read the label because I'm a hologram.
