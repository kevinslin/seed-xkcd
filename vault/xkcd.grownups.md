![I've looked into this, and I can't figure out a way to do it cheaply.  And I guess it wouldn't be sanitary.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/grownups.png)

## Transcript
[[Man is talking to Woman who is behind a waste-high screen across a doorway with colorful playpen balls behind her.]]
Man: Hey, I was wondering if you had plans for-- holy crap, what happened to your apartment?
Woman: I filled it with playpen balls!
Man: I... what? Why?
Woman: Because we're grown-ups now, and it's our turn to decide what that means.
[[Both vanish into the apartment, balls spilling out into the corridor. A love heart drifts out the door, indicating you-know-what]]
