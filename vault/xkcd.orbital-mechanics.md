![To be fair, my job at NASA was working on robots and didn't actually involve any orbital mechanics. The small positive slope over that period is because it turns out that if you hang around at NASA, you get in a lot of conversations about space.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/orbital_mechanics.png)

## Transcript
[A line graph labeled 'How Well I Understand Orbital Mechanics:'. The x-axis is labeled 'time -->'. The line starts slightly above 0 at the y-axis and increases very little until a point at which it peaks slightly, labeled 'took high school physics'. It decreases slightly for a while and then increases significantly over a short period of time, the peak of which is labeled 'got physics degree'. It dips shallowly for a while, then starts to increase slightly for a time, labeled 'actual job at NASA'. The line starts to slope downward again, and then shoots up very, very high. The beginning of this increase is labeled 'started playing Kerbal Space Program'.]]
