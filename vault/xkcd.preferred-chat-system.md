## Transcript
[[A figure stands, talking on his cell phone.]]
Figure: Sorry for the voicemail, but I'm confused about how to reach you. 

Figure: When I text you, you reply once on GChat, then go quiet, yet answer IRC right away. I emailed you, and you replied on Skype and mentioned that the email "woke you up." 

Figure: You're very responsive - I just have no sense of how you use technology. 

[[An owl flies into the panel.]]
Figure: ?!?

[[The owl perches on the figure's head. It has delivered a note to the figure.]]
Note: did you try to call me? use my google voice number next time. 

{{Title text: If you call my regular number, it just goes to my pager.}}
