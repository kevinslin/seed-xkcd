## Transcript
Author Katherine Gates recently attempted to make a chart of all sexual fetishes.
Little did she know that Russel and Whitehead had already failed at this same task.
[[Russel and Whitehead are standing with GÃ¶del, Russel holding a clipboard and smoking a pipe.]]
Russel: Hey, GÃ¶del âÂ we're compiling a comprehensive list of fetishes.  What turns you on?
GÃ¶del: Anything not on your list.
Russel: Uhâ¦hm.
