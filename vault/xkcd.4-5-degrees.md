![The good news is that according to the latest IPCC report, if we enact aggressive emissions limits now, we could hold the warming to 2°C. That's only HALF an ice age unit, which is probably no big deal.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/4_5_degrees.png)

## Transcript
Without prompt, aggressive limits on CO2 emissions, the Earth will likely warm by an average of 4°-5°C by the century's end.
How big a change is that?
[[The panel shows a temperature scale.]]
In the coldest part of the last ice age, Earth's average temperature was 4.5°C below the 20th century norm.
Let's call a 4.5°C difference one "Ice Age unit."
