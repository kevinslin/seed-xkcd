## Transcript
[[Two characters are standing in a basement, the support beams bare.]]
Enthusiast: I want to build a perfect HO-scale (~1
87) model train layout of my town.
Realist: In your basement?  Bad idea.  Never make a layout of the area you're in.

Enthusiast: Why not?
Realist: Because it'd include a little 10" replica of your house.

Enthusiast: So? That'd be cool! I'd make tiny replicas of my rooms, my furniture--
Realist: --And your train layout?

((Break free of the traditional panel system.  The following appear in magnification circles, going beyond an original large diagram.  Each is labeled with a length scale arrow.))
[[The characters are looking at an HO-scale model railroad, with prominent mountains and a town nestled in the valley.]]
<-- 18m -->

[[Zoomed in on the first model house.]]
<-- 21cm -->

[[Zoomed in on the second house.  There is a gnat sitting on the model.]]
<-- 2.4mm -->

[[Zoomed in on the third house.  A strand of spiderweb crosses the model, labeled.]]
Spider web
<-- 28Î¼m -->

[[Zoomed in on the fourth house.  A cold virus is sitting on the model, which is distinctly composed of tiny dots.]]
Cold virus.
<-- 320nm -->

[[Zoomed in on the fifth house.  The entire diorama is composed of large spheres.  It appears Dalton's billiard ball model is correct in the comic universe.]]
<-- 37Å -->

((A final comment, and normal panels resume.))
The Matryoshka Limit: It is impossible to nest more than six HO layouts.

[[The two are standing together once again.]]
Enthusiast: My God.
Realist: Yeah. It's the second rule of model train layouts: No nesting.

Enthusiast: ... what's the first rule?
Realist: "Do 
not
 talk about model train layouts."  That rule was actually voted in by our friends and families.
Enthusiast: Philistines.
