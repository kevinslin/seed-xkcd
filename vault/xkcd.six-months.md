![But then she does that thing with her tongue and I remember why I left you.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/six_months.png)

## Transcript
[[A guy stands]]
Guy: It's been six months and I still have those dreams where you're pressed tight against me, where you look into my eyes and give me that grin and it's like you've forgotten everything.
Guy: And something in the back of my head says it's wrong, it's not like this anymore, but I push it down.  In the morning, I tell myself I can't control my dreams, but there's a part of me that doesn't want them to stop.
Guy: And honestly, waking up would be a lot easier if your mom didn't look so much like you.
Guy: There's always that moment of confusion.
{{title-text: But then she does that thing with her tongue and I remember why I left you.}}
