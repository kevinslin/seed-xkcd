## Transcript
[[One character sits in front of a computer, Hat Guy behind him]]
Person: This writer's strike sucks.
Hat Guy: Why? You don't watch sitcoms.
Person: Yeah, but it sucks having political campaigns without Jon Stewart's commentary.
Hat Guy: True. I finally got sick of it a couple weeks ago.
Person: And you quit following the campaigns?
Hat Guy: No. I kidnapped Jon Stewart to do analysis for me.
Person: You what?
Hat Guy [[Pointing at a door]]: He's locked in the basement.
Hat Guy: Jon! Obama's leading in Iowa! Gimme a wry, witty comment on the situation!
Stewart [[Voice coming from door]]: Please let me go. I have a family.
{{Alt: He's just jealous because everyone's up in the attic listening to Stephen Colbert.}}
