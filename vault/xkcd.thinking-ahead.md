## Transcript
[[My Problem: Thinking Ahead]]
Man: She's cute.
Woman: This food is problematic.
Man: Oh man, she's quoting Firefly.
Man: It's the perfect opening. But wait. I'm moving in the fall. If we hit it off, how will I deal with that?
Man: I don't want to ask her to derail her plans. And with things unresolved with Megan, can I really commit enough to make that kind of decision?
Man: Oh God.
Man: Gotta get out.
Man: The window.
<<CRASH>>
