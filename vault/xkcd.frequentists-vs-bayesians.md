## Transcript
Did the sun just explode? (It's night, so we're not sure)

[[Two statisticians stand alongside an adorable little computer that is suspiciously similar to K-9 that speaks in Westminster typeface]]
Frequentist Statistician: This neutrino detector measures whether the sun has gone nova.
Bayesian Statistician: Then, it rolls two dice. If they both come up as six, it lies to us.  Otherwise, it tells the truth.
FS: Let's try. [[to the detector]] Detector! Has the sun gone nova?
Detector: <<roll>> YES.

Frequentist Statistician:
FS: The probability of this result happening by chance is 1
36=0.027.  Since p< 0.05, I conclude that the sun has exploded.

Bayesian Statistician:
BS: Bet you $50 it hasn't.
