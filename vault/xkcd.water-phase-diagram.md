## Transcript
[[A phase diagram of water, with temperature on the horizontal axis increasing to the left, and pressure on the vertical axis increasing downwards.  It shows the commonly known phases of water (ice, liquid, vapor) as well as the more exotic high-pressure phases Ice II, Ice III and Ice V.  As pressure increases, the diagram shows Vanilla Ice (Ice VI) transitioning to David Bowie & Queen.]]
