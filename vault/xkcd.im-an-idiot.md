## Transcript
[[Ponytailed stick figure approaches stick figure, who is sitting on porch steps, laptop in lap and backpack open]]
Ponytailed stick figure: Should  I ask?
Stick figure: I'm locked out, and I'm trying to get my roommate to let me in.
[[unplugged cell phone on table]]
Stick figure: First I tried her cell phone, but it's off.
[[Stick figure sitting on steps, laptop in lap and gesturing]]
Stick figure: Then I tried IRC, but she's not online.
[[Stick figure standing in front of house and looking up at window]]
Stick figure: I couldn't find anything to throw at her window,
[[living room with couch
easy chair and computer set up]]
Stick figure: so I SSH'd into the Mac Mini in the living room and got the speech synth to yell at her for me.
Computer: Hey I'm locked out downstairs
[[Roommate sitting at table with laptop open]]
Stick figure: But I think I left the volume way down, so I'm reading the OS X docs to learn to set the volume via command line.
[[Ponytailed stick figure facing stick figure, who is still sitting on the porch with his laptop.]]
Ponytailed stick figure: Ah.
Ponytailed stick figure: I take it the doorbell doesn't work?
[[Ponytailed stick figure characters remain in place, Stick figure tilts head back slightly, as if staring in realization]]
