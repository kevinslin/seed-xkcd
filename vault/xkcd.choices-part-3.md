## Transcript
[[A girl floats in a bubble against a space backdrop]]
Girl: I should feel scared.
But I don't.
Maybe this is a dream
but it doesn't feel like one.
Disembodied voice: Okay, found you.
Girl: Who are you?
Voice: Er, hang on.  This next part might be a little weird.
[[No dialogue]]
[[Many copies of the girl whirl around her bubble; a lightning bolt appears in the background]]
[[All the copies have disappeared except for one]]
Copy: Sorry -- Hi, me.
Girl: ...Hi.
