![Somewhere in the world, my actual grandmothers are reading this and angrily exclaiming that I never write even malformed thank-you notes.  DEAR GRANDMOMS: I AM SORRY! YOU ARE WONDERFUL PEOPLE AND THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.  LOVE reddit.com RANDALL.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/typewriter.png)

## Transcript
[[A typewriter is shown with the following letter in it:
Dear Grandmom,    cnn.com
    I hope this    reddit.com    letter
finds you well.    I wanted to say I
really    news.google.com    enjoyed the
trip you    boingboing.net    took us on,
and am looking forward to    bbc.co.uk
visiting later    fivethirtyeight.com
this year.
				Love,    slashdot.org

				Your grandson,]]
I didn't realize how bad my habit of tabbing to Firefox every few seconds to check news sites had gotten until I tried writing on a typewriter.
