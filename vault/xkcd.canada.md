## Transcript
[[Two men stand talking to each other]]
First Man: If we lose this election, I'm moving to Canada.
Second Man: You say that every year.
First Man: I mean it this time.
Second Man: Well, becoming a citizen takes work.  Meanwhile, you have no money, half an art degree, and it's the start of winter.  You'll freeze to death in the streets.
First Man: Whatever.
[[Second man raises his hands]]
Second Man: No, don't you get it?  If you die in Canada, you die in REAL LIFE!
