## Transcript
((The whole comic is a single panel, with a circular diagram of the days of the week.))
Polar graph of what stuff happens on which days, based on number of Google results for phrases like "company meeting on <day>."
The relative frequency of <day> in <phrase> is shown by the distance from the center at which <phrase>'s line crosses <day>.
Each curve is normalized to have the same number of total hits - they're not on the same scale.
((Not easy to reproduce the actual plot, these are the phrases, in order of popularity on Wednesday.))
1. <day> is ladies night
2. announced <day>
3. company meeting on <day> 
 company meeting <day>
4. due on <day>
5. got laid <day>
6. drunk on <day> 
 so drunk <day>
7. <day> is the big day
8. Church <day>
9. got my period <day>
10. we broke up on <day>
11. <day> sucked
((Thursday, from most common to least common: 11, 2, 1, 3, 9, 4, 5, 7, 10, 6, 8))
((Friday, from most common to least common: 10, 4, 6, 7, 5, 9, 11, 3, 2, 1, 8))
((Saturday, ditto: 6, 7, 5, 11, 9, 10, 8, 3, 2, 1, 4))
