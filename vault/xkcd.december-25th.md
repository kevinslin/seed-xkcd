![If you're turning 27 and were born in the Northeast, maybe you were conceived in the April blizzard of 1982. Imagine: snowed in, candles, massage oil, your mom sporting nothing but her early 80's haircut and a smile ... aren't you glad you read the title-text?](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/december_25th.png)

## Transcript
[[On one side, a family of four gathered around a Christmas tree, the daughter and son looking excitedly at the presents under the tree; on the other, a character wearing a party hat, sitting dejectedly before a birthday cake. The panel edges are decorated with holly and a wreath.]]
Happy Birthday to those of you born on the 25th!
Sorry you get kinda shafted by the overlap with Christmas.
