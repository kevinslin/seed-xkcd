## Transcript
[[Two people are talking by telephone.  The first two panels are split diagonally.  The first person is at a store, and the second is consulting with them.]]
[[The first person has a small box.]]
Person: Do we have an RCA-to-3.5mm female-female plug? I'm getting some speakers for the new xBox, since the monitor doesn't have any.

Second Person: Are they crappy laptop speakers?

[[The person is moving away from a sale rack.  It says "Sale!!" several times.]]
Person: Does it matter? I just want to hear if I'm getting shot at, not saor eery detail of a beautiful musical soundscape.
Second Person: You've never 
heard
 a beautiful musical soundscape. You listen to 96kbps flv rips from YouTube.

Person: Whatever.  I'm just going to get these $20 speakers.  Five watts will be plenty.  
Second Person: Five watts for a living room sound system?  Is that a joke?

Person: No, this is a joke: How many audiophiles does it take to change a lightbulb?
Second Person: How many?
Person: I'll tell you later - you wouldn't appreciate the punchline over this 12kbps cell phone codec.
