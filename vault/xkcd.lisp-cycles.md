## Transcript
[[Guy sitting at computer. Girl listening]]
Guy: Lisp is over half a century old and it still has this perfect, timeless air about it.
Guy: I wonder if the cycles will continue forever.
Guy: A few coders from each new generation rediscovering the Lisp arts.
[[Man in Jedi robes carrying an armload of parentheses, speaking to Guy]]
Jedi: These are your father's parentheses. Elegant weapons. For a more... civilized age.
