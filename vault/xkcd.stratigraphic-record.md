![All we have are these stupid tantalizing zircons and the scars on the face of the Moon.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/stratigraphic_record.png)

## Transcript
[[A view of the Earth from space.]]
Nearly 4.5 billion years ago, Earth had liquid water. But all the crust older than 3.5 billion years has been recycled into the mantle by subduction.

[[The same view.]]
A billion years of the stratigraphic record, the memory of the hills, is forever lost to us. What was it 
like
 here, four billion years ago?

[[The same view.]]
Earth, what 
secrets
 do you have?

[[The same view.]]
Earth: come closer

[[A closer view.]]

[[An even closer view.]]
Earth: 
i'll never tell.
