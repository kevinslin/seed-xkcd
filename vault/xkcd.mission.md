## Transcript
[[Two figures, one in a beret, are rappelling down separate ropes into the interior workings of a large machine]]
Man 1: Okay, we're in the belly of the machine. You got the charges?
Man 2 (with beret): The what?
[[The two are standing next to some large pieces of machinery]]
Man 1 [[gesturing]: The explosive charges!
Man 2 [[pulling out a bag]]: I just brought this bag for pastries.
Man 1: The hell? We're on a mission here!
Man 2 [[looking around]]: This isn't a bakery?
Man 1 [[head in hand]]: Oh, Christ, not this shit again.
Man 2 [[crouching by some lug nuts lying on a piece of machinery]]: What about these scones?
Man 1: Those are lug nuts.
Man 2 [[stuffing them in his mouth]]: ...Maybe SOME of them aren't. <<crunch>> Ow! <<crunch>>
