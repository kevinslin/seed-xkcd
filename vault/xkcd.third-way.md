## Transcript
[[Two groups stand, with placards and weapons, angrily facing off against each other. The first group, with a cutlass, has a sign reading "TWO spaces after a period". The second group, with a spear, has a sign reading "ONE space after a period." Off to one side stands a figure, alone, with a placard reading "Line break after every sentence."]]
