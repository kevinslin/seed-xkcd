## Transcript
Trivia: It's possible to create events which Wikipedia cannot cover neutrally
Man in Hat: In a week, I will be donating $1,000,000 to a recipient determined by the word count of the Wikipedia article about this event. If it's even, the money goes to pro-choice activists. If it's odd, pro-life.
