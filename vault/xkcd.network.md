## Transcript
[[ Girl looking at a large screen with many green and red squares. The squares have writing in them and lines connecting them.]]
[[Side view. The screen is a huge LCD connected to a wireless router.]]
Guy: Pretty, isn't it?
Girl: What is it?
Guy: I've got a bunch of virtual Windows machines networked together, hooked up to an incoming pipe from the net. They execute email attachments, share files, and have no security patches.
Guy: Between them they have practically every virus.
Guy: There are mail trojans, warhol worms, and all sorts of exotic polymorphics. A monitoring system adds and wipes machines at random. The display shows the viruses as they move through the network. Growing and struggling.
[[Guy walks past the girl and touches the monitor]]
Girl: You know, normal people just have aquariums.
Guy: Good morning, Blaster. Are you and W32.Welchia getting along?
Guy: Who's a good virus? You are! Yes, you are!
