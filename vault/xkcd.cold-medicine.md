## Transcript
[[Two figures stand behind a table with cheese, bread, tomato sauce, and salt on it.]]
Figure: What're you having for lunch? 
Other figure: The usual - half a pound of cheese, white bread, a glass of tomato sauce, and some salt.
Figure: Eww. 
Pizza seems way grosser if you imagine eating just the ingredients.

{{Title text: I'm trying to be healthier, so after I eat this brick of cheese, I'll have a spoonful of grease-soaked vegetables.}}
