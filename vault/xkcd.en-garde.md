## Transcript
[[Two fencers stand facing each other. The left one has his sword up; the right one keeps his lowered.]]
Left fencer: En garde!
Right fencer: OK. 

Right fencer: No matter how long we know each other, when you ask "What are you thinking," I will always pause before answering. 

Left fencer: Maybe a little less guarded?
Right fencer: No way. I've been hurt before.
