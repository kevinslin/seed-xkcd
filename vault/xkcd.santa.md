## Transcript
[[Two characters are walking and talking.]]
Character: Say Santa eats a cookie at every few houses.  That's hundreds of tons.  By the end of the night, he should be a hulking seven-story behemoth.
Character: But he's not.

[[The characters stop and face one another.]]
Second character: What are you...
Character: Does Santa poop in our houses?

[[They continue to walk.]]
Second character: No way.
Character: That mass must be going somewhere.
Second character: He has that magic bag...
Character: You think he poops in the bag of

[[The second character gestures thoughtfully.]]
Second character: Maybe instead of pooping in every few houses, he waits, and then in a few houses, he poops a

.
Character: And what if no one's been

 naughty?
Second character: He picks at random.  The needs of the many...

{{Title text: He probably just poops over the side of the sleigh.}}
