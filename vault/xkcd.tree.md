## Transcript
[[There is a binary Christmas tree, with each node a ball, and lights strung between parent and child nodes.  Beneath it is a heap of presents - sorted with the largest on top, smaller presents connected to it with string.  Next to the tree are a kid and his or her parents.]]
Billy: It's a Christmas tree with a heap of presents underneath!
Mother: ... We're not inviting you home next year.
