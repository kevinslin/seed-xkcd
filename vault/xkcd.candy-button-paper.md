## Transcript
When it came to eating strips of candy buttons, there were two main strategies.  Some kids carefully removed each bead, checking closely for paper residue before eating.
Others tore the candy off haphazardly, swallowing large scraps of paper as they ate.
Then there were the lonely few of us who moved back and forth on the strip, eating rows of beads here and there, pretending we were Turing machines.
