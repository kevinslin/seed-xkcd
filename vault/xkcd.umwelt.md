the first frame has a human-size bump, the second has a third person looking at the snake, and the third has the snake going though two Portals;
a squirrel and the human-size bump in the first frame, a ring next to the third person in the second frame, and Beret Guy riding the snake in front of the portal;
or
The squirrel, a fourth person within the snake being coiled, and the human bump in the first frame, the ring, a fifth person in love, and the third person in the second frame, Beret Guy and the portal in the third frame, and the same two people in the fourth frame.]]

Something about a podcast,
Someone confused because the description doesn't match the link,
The link you clicked on to get to this comic,
Rob Delaney,
