![When Guitar Hero 2 comes out I'll have fresh conversational material for MONTHS.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/music_knowledge.png)

## Transcript
[[A female and male figure converse]]
Female: What kind of music do you listen to?
Male: Oh, a mix of things. Some classic rock like Boston, but then of course Queen and Bowie, Joan Jett...
Female: Definitely, we need more of those sounds.
Male: But there's some great newer stuff too, like Franz Ferdinand, The Donnas, and Audioslave.
Female: Sometimes they're a little much for me. I go more for things like The Arcade Fire, sometimes mixing some electronic sounds like Postal Service.
Male: Oh yeahâhave you ever checked out Freezepop?
Female: Mhm! Synth pop can be fun, but at the same time, I agree that sometimes you just need to blast some Metallica.
Male: Who?
Female: ...Metallica.
Male: Are they new?
Narrator: I sound pretty knowledgeable about music until people figure out that I'm just naming bands from Guitar Hero.
