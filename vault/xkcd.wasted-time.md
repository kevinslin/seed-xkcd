![Since it sounds like your time spent typing can't possibly be less productive than your time spent not typing, have you tried typing SLOWER?](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/wasted_time.png)

## Transcript
((Two characters are talking. One is wielding a small electronic device. The other is wearing a hat.))

Hacker: This new keyboard is like thirty percent faster! I'm never going back.
Haberdasher: Good, put those years of horror behind you.
Hacker: Come on. Sure, sometimes my focus on efficiency doesn't make sense. But we type a LOT. That 30% improvement pretty quickly adds up to a HUGE amount of wasted time rescued.
Haberdasher: I just watched you open google news and then close it without reading it FIVE TIMES IN A ROW.
Hacker: The fact that I spend most of my time so stupidly only makes it MORE important not to waste any here.
