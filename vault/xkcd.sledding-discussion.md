## Transcript
[[Girl looks out window through blinds]]
Girl: It's snowing!
Boy: [[from off-screen]] Sled time!
[[Girl and boy outside with sled, at the top of a hill]]
Boy: It depresses me that I'm too old to learn another language fluently.  My brain's solidified.
[[Girl and boy sledding down the hill]]
Girl: Is there one you wish you knew?
Boy: No, I just hate having options closed to me.  Like I've given up a life that was once possible.
[[At the bottom of the hill, sled has stopped]]
Girl: Which reminds me -- our anniversary is coming up.
Girl: Man, that ride failed to be a metaphor for our conversation.
Boy: Guess this isn't the Calvin & Hobbes-model toboggan.
