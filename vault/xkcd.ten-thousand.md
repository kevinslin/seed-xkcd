![Saying 'what kind of an idiot doesn't know about the Yellowstone supervolcano' is so much more boring than telling someone about the Yellowstone supervolcano for the first time.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/ten_thousand.png)

## Transcript
I try not to make fun of people for admitting they don't know things.
Because for each thing "veeryone knows by the time they're adults, every day there are, on average, 10,000 people in the US hearing about it for the first time.
Fraction who have heard of it at birth = 0%
Fraction who have heard of it by 30 ~= 100%
US birth rate ~= 4,000,000
year
Number hearing about it for the first time ~= 10,000
day

If I make fun of people, I train them not to tell me when they have those moments.  And I miss out on the fun.
Person #1, about to have a messy fun time: "Diet coke and mentos thing"? What's that?
Person #2, in a delightfully pro-knowledge mood: Oh man! come on, we're going to the grocery store.
Person #1: Why?
Person #2: You're one of today's lucky 10,000.
