## Transcript
((All of the panels of this comic are white-on-black.))

[[Two figures stand facing each other, looking up at the sky.]]
Figure One: Just think - the light from that start was emitted thousands of years ago. It could be long gone.

[[Figure One looks at Figure Two, who is still looking up.]]
Figure Two: That's Sirius. It's eight light-years away.

[[Figure One looks up again.]]
Figure One: Oh.

[[The two figures look at one another.]]
Figure One: Just think - the light from that star was emitted in the previous presidential administration.
Figure Two: Hmm, doesn't pack quite the punch.
