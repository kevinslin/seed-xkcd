![You should talk to the girl down the hall; I think you'd like her.  Lemme know if you find out why she's ordering all those colored plastic balls.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/lease.png)

## Transcript
[[A man is holding a sheet of paper.]]
Man #1: Okay, any other concerns before you sign the lease?

Man #2: I'm concerned that we're sitting here like I'm a responsible adult. I'm pretty sure I stopped growing up in my teens and have been faking ever since.

Man #2: For god's sake, you're entrusting me with a 
building
. I still make LEGO buildings sometimes.

Man #1: Sir, does any of this impact your fulfillment of the lease terms?
Man #2: I don't know what you just said because I was thinking about Batman.
