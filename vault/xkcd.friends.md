## Transcript
[[A boy is talking to a girl.]]
Boy: I have a crush on you.
[[Boy is shown alone.]]
Boy: I could ask you out, and move on with my life if you said no.
Boy: Or, WE COULD BE FRIENDS!
Boy: See, I don't want to consider that you might not be attracted to me. I'm scared of rejection, so I've decided relationships should grow smoothly out of friendships.
[[Girl is shown sitting at her computer.]]
Boy: When you have problems, I'll be there for you, night after night.
Boy: Selflessly.
Computer (Instant message from boy): *hug*
[[Girl is shown slamming door and walkng to boy to get a hug.]]
Boy: I'll tear down the jerks you date, and wait for you to realize how good I am for you. That only I will ever understand you.
<<SLAM>>
Girl: <<Sniff>>
Boy: There there
[[Boy is shown alone again.]]
Boy: You don't want to hurt my feelings, and I won't ever force the issue. I'll tell myself it's because I "Value our friendship."
Boy: Bit by bit, I'll make you depend on me.
[[Boy and girl are shown sitting on a rock in a park, reading a book together.]]
Boy: You'll think about how long it would take to build this kind of connection again.
[[Boy and girl are shown sitting on a couch drinking, getting closer, and kissing.]]
Boy: And in a moment of weakness
Boy: and loneliness
Boy: you'll give in.
[[Girl is shown sitting at the computer with boy behind her facing the other way washing dishes]]
Boy: It'll feel comfortable and natural. You'll quietly revise your definition of love and try to be happy. And sometimes you will be.
[[Girl is shown siting at the computer.]]
Boy: Only the wistfulness in your gaze and the tiny pause before you say "I love you" will hint that this wasn't the ending you'd hoped for.
Boy: Sound good?
[[Girl is holding hands with another boy, talking to boy.]]
Girl: ...I'm going to date this jerk.
Boy: But he doesn't respect you!
