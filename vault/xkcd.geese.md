## Transcript
[[A figure and a woman lie on the ground, looking up at the sky. A flock of geese fly into frame in a V.]]

[[The geese fly across the panel.]]

[[The geese have passed. The woman points at the sky.]]
Woman: To think... we're seeing light that left those geese centuries ago. By now, they could be long dead.

[[The figure props himself up to turn around and look at her.]]
Figure: ... What? They're a few hundred yards away. I hear them honking.
Woman: Ah, yes. You're hearing how they once sounded.
Figure: You're very weird.
Woman: Or I was, long ago...
