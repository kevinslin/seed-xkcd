## Transcript
[[A man sits at his computer desk, motioning toward the screen as a woman stands behind him.]]
Man: I don't get why authors and comedians spend so much energy trying to be clever on Twitter. Couldn't they put that creativity into more books and scripts? -- Is there something they 
like
 about the 140-character format?

[[Same picture, only the man has his arm down.]]
Woman: Yeah. Writers working under tight restrictions produce novel material -- like, for example, epigrams employing backward alphabetization.

[[The man remains at his computer desk. The woman is no longer in the frame.]]
Man: ...whoa.
