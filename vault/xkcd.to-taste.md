## Transcript
[[Three women and a figure stand in a salt mine. There's a control panel with two benches in the centre, and two piles of salt to the right. Two figures are talking, and two are shovelling salt into their mouths.]]
Woman 1: So you've build this particle detector in a salt mine to block out cosmic rays? 
Woman 2: Yes. That is definitely why. 
Woman 3 and figure: <<Homf nomf nomf>>

{{Title text: This one is a little bland. Pass the saltshaker?}}
