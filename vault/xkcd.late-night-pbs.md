## Transcript
[[Scruffy is rubbing sleep out of their eyes and talking to clean shaven.]]
Scruffy: Have you ever watched PBS late at night?
Scruffy: I fell asleep after 
Downton
 and woke up at like 3 AM.

[[The upper portion of the panel continues dialogue, while the lower shows a drunk gameshow host and several contestants.  The monitor shows a field of crosses, presumably graves.]]
Scruffy: 
Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego
 was back on, except the host hadn't aged well and he'd clearly been drinking.
Scruffy: Every question took them to some horrible place like Mogadishu or the Cambodian killing fields.

[[Now it shows a bookshelf revealing a hidden room.]]
Scruffy: The kids were freaked out, but they kept playing.  Eventually they were told they'd found Carmen Sandiego hiding behind a bookshelf in a Dutch apartment.

Scruffy: The Chief appeared and asked "Are you 
proud
 of what you've become?"
Scruffy: Then Rockapella walked out and just glared at the kids until they started crying.
Clean-shaven: I, uh, don't remember the old show being that dark.
Scruffy: Maybe we were too young to pick up on it.
