![I looked at some of the data dumps from vulnerable sites, and it was ... bad. I saw emails, passwords, password hints. SSL keys and session cookies. Important servers brimming with visitor IPs. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion, c-beams glittering in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. I should probably patch OpenSSL.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/heartbleed.png)

## Transcript
[[Two people are walking along, one is looking at her phone.]]
Person 1: Heartbleed must be the worst web security lapse ever.
Person 2: Worst so far. Give us time.

[[Still walking, first person is now holding her phone at her side.]]
Person 1: I mean, this bg isn't just broken encryption. It lets website visitors make a server dispense random memory contents.

[[They stop walking and face each other.]]
Person 1: It's not just keys. It's traffic data. Emails. Passwords. Erotic fanfiction.
Person 2: Is 
everything
 compromised?

[[They begin walking again.]]
Person 1: Well, the attack is limited to data stored in computer memory.
Person 2: So paper is safe. And clay tablets.
Person 1: Our imaginations, too.
Person 2: See, we'll be fine.
