![If at first you don't succeed, that's one data point.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/resolution.png)

## Transcript
Man: I'm scared of being stuck Â– thinking I'm fixing things about myself but never actually changing. 

Man: My 2013 resolution is to break out of loops. To recognize when I'm not making progress, stop yelling at myself, and try a different approach. 

Off-screen character: Wasn't that also your resolution last year?
[[The man shakes his fist.]]
Man: Yeah, but *this* year's gonna be different.
