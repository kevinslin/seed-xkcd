## Transcript
[[Interior, a man sits at his computer typing, woman enters]]
Man [typing]: ...and that's why music DRM is bad for listeners and artists!
Woman[off-panel]: What are you doing?
Woman: In case you didn't notice, we won the music DRM war.  The big stores are DRM free.
Woman: So close the comment thread, get out the debit card, buy us some music, and let's rock the fuck out.
Man: But I don't actually like music, I just like being self-righteous on the web.
Woman: Lucky for you, that will always be free.
