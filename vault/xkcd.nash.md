## Transcript
[[Two men stand talking two each other.  The first man is pointing off the panel]]
First Man: Hey, Dr. Nash, I think those gals over there are eyeing us.  This is like your Nash Equilibrium, right?  One of them is hot, but we should each flirt with one of her less-desirable friends.  Otherwise we risk coming on too strong to the hot one and just driving the group off.
Second Man (Dr. Nash): Well, that's not really the sort of situation I wrote about.  Once we're with the ugly ones, there's no incentive for one of us not to try to switch to the hot one.  It's not a stable equilibrium.
First Man: Crap, forget it.  Looks like all three are leaving with one guy.
[[Second Man shakes his fist]]
Second Man (Dr. Nash): Dammit, Feynman!
