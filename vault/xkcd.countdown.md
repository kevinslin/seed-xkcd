## Transcript
[[Hat guy sits at his computer. A man stands behind him. On the wall is a digital countdown, partially obscured by a picture of a sunset. The part of the countdown we can see reads "0002409".]]
Man: What's that? 
Hat guy: Countdown. 

[[The countdown now reads "0002400".]]
Man: To what? 
Hat guy: Supervolcano, I think. I forget which one.

[[The countdown now reads "0002396".]]

[[The countdown now reads "0002382".]]
Man: Maybe we should move that picture? 
Hat guy: Too hard to reach. It's probably fine.
