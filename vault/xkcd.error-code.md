## Transcript
[[A man sits at a computer, while another man takes a book off a shelf behind him.]]
Man #1: "Error -41"? That's helpful. It doesn't even say which program it's from!
Man #2: -41? I'll look it up...

[[The second man looks at the book.]]
Man #2: It says -41 is: "Sit by a lake." 

[[The two walk.]]

[[The two sit down.]]

[[A large, in-color painting of a lake with pond lilies.]]

[[The two are still sitting.]]
Man #1: I don't know where you got that book, but I like it.
Man #2: Hasn't been wrong yet.
