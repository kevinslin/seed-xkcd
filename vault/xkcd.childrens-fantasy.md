![I was going to be a scientist, but that seems silly now. Magical worlds exist. I've learned a huge truth about our place in the universe. I'm supposed to care about college? I mean, FUCK.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/childrens_fantasy.png)

## Transcript
[[Kid is sitting on the ground with his chin in his hand.]]
Kid: I'm such a loser--
<<POP>>
[[Princess sticks her head through a portal.]]
Princess: Come quickly, young one!
Kid: Holy crap, a portal!
Princess: My kingdom needs you!

[[He falls through.]]
Kid: AAAAAA

[[We see him on horseback, helmeted wielding a sword. There's a castle on the horizon and two moons in the sky.]]

[[Kid, with helmet and sword, stands before King, Princess, and another warrior. Princess is holding out a ring.]]
King: You've saved our kingdom and found your self-confidence. Now it's time to return home. Goodbye, young hero!
Princess: Take this ring to remember us!

[[Kid stands alone, holding the ring.]]
Kid: Well, I guess I spend the rest of my life pretending that didn't happen or knowing that everyone I love suspects I'm crazy.
Kid: This'll be a fun 70 years.
