Hat Guy: During a competition, I told the programmers on our team that e^pi-pi was a standard test of floating-point handlers--it would come out to 20 unless they had rounding errors.
Person: That's awful.
Hat Guy: Yeah, they dug through half their algorithms looking for the bug before they figured it out.
