## Transcript
[[A man sits at a computer, talking to a woman off screen.]]
Man: Oh, *wow*. Look at Wikipedia's talk page for Star Trek into Darkness. I have a new favorite edit war. 
Woman: Oh? 

[[The woman walks up to look over his shoulder.]]
Man: Forty *thousand* words of debate over whether to capitalise "into" in the movie's title. Still no consensus.
Woman: That's *magnificient*.
Man: It's breathtaking. 
Woman: They should have sent a poet. 

[[We see a close-up of the man. He's typing.]]
Well, I'm making an executive decision. I hope both sides accept this as a fair compromise. 
<<Type type>>

[[We see the Wikipedia page. The title is now "~*~ StAr TrEk InTo DaRkNeSs ~*~"]]
