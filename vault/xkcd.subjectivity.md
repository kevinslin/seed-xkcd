## Transcript
[tall slide, seen from the ground]
When I was a kid, my school playground had a really tall slide that always made me nervous
[tall slide, seen from the side]
We moved away, but the slide stuck in my memory, becoming a skyscraping monster
[car and a sign pointing to school zone]
Years later, I was passing through my old town and remembered the playground
I drove to the school to see the slide that my inner six-year-old thought was so towering
[huge slide, (small) person beside it]
AND IT WAS HUGE
I KNEW IT
