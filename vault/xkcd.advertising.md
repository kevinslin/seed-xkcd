## Transcript
Mathematically Annoying Advertising:

[[A âª B = {x:x â¤ 15 or x > 15 } = â ]]
[[line graph representing the above equation]]
When discussing real numbers, it is impossible to get more vague than "up to 15% or more".

[["FREE*" in large text, with substantial illegible fine print]]
If someone has paid $x to have the word "free" typeset for you and N other people to read, their expected value for the money that will move from you to them is at least $(x
(N+1))

[[graph representing inverse relationship between "amount you spend" on the y axis and "amount you save" on the x axis]]
It would be difficult for the phrase "the more you spend the more you save" to be more wrong.
