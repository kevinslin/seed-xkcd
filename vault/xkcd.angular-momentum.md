## Transcript
[[Man sits on his bed, looking at a girl who is spinning.  It is night.]]
Man on bed: What are you doing? 
Girl: Spinning counterclockwise
Each turn robs the planet of angular momentum
Slowing its spin by the tiniest bit
Lengthening the night, pushing back the dawn
Giving me a little more time here
With you
