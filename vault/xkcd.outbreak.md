## Transcript
The outbreak started with Patient Zero ...
[[Two scientists, a man and a woman, stand outside a lab. A zombie is visible through the window.]]
Man: He was exposed to toxin X-7--now he's a bloodthirsty monster!
Woman: Has he been in isolation?
Zombie: Braaains!

Man: Yes, but I can't hold this door for long!
Woman: Hang on, I've got a gun in my truck.
[[She runs off.]]
Zombie (through door): <<wham>>

[[The man opens the door as the woman shoots through it.]]
<<BLAM>>

And ended with Patient Zero five minutes later.
Man: So, I never got your name. I'm Ryan.
Woman: Laura.
The remaining 90 minutes of the movie will be a romantic comedy.
