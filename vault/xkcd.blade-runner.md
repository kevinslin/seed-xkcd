## Transcript
[[Guy 1 is talking to Guy 2, who is on the sofa watching TV]]
Guy 1: What DVD is this?
Guy 2: Blade Runner. I got it for Christmas.
Guy 1: The one with Harrison Ford, right? And the Olsen twins?
Guy 2: Ye- What? Olsen twins? No, this is the 80's sci-fi classic!
Guy 1: Huh. I didn't know the Olsen twins even did sci-fi.
Guy 2: ... they don't.
Guy 1: So is Ashely the replicant, or is Mary-Kate? I can never tell them apart.
Guy 2: Neither! They're not in this movie!
Guy 1: Then who is?
Guy 2: Daryl Hannah!
Guy 1: I liked her in Full House.
Guy 2: I hate you.
Guy 1: Man, this movie is just a New York Minute rip-off.
{{ Blade Runner: classic, but incredibly slow. }}
