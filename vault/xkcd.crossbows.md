## Transcript
[[Man 1 is pulling a crossbow out of a desk]]
Man 1: Why do you have a crossbow in your desk?
Woman (off-screen): You _don't_?
[[Woman is on panel]]
Man 1 (off-screen): No -- why would...
Woman: You _are_ studying the consequences of Higgs excitation, aren't you?  Like the rest of the lab?
[[Two men, both holding crossbows, joing the woman on panel]]
Man 1: Yes, but why--
Man 2: Maybe he's slow with the math.
Woman: Well, he has until Tuesday.
Man 2: Poor guy.
