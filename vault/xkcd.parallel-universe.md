## Transcript
[[Two people are standing next to a large pentagram with candles at the points. A figure is hovering above it in a wave of energy.]]
Person 1: Sweet. I summoned myself from a parallel universe.
Person 2: You know, he could vanish at any moment.
Person 2: You should take this chance to make out with yourself.
Person 2: . . . you know, _I_ could vanish at any moment.
