![The Fujita Scale was replaced by the Enhanced Fujita Scale in 2007, but I think 'EF-5' sounds stupid, so I vote we just use the new measurements for assigning numbers but still call them 'F-whatever'.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tornado_hunter.png)

## Transcript
[[Two people are in a car, which is driving past a cactus.  The passenger has a pith helmet and a mustache.]]
Driver: The tornado's three miles west, moving northeast at 15 mph.
Passenger: Go right; get ahead of it.

[[A tornado is visible.  The passenger pulls out a gun, and stands up in the car.]]
Passenger: Okay, we're in range! Stop here!

[[The passenger fires a gun at the tornado.]]
<<BANG>>
Tornado: AUGH!

Passenger: Big one! Must be an F-3!
Driver: I'm not sure we're doing this right.
Passenger: Help me mount it on the hood.
[[The passenger is holding the tornado by its tail.]]
