## Transcript
((not a character; just a colon in a normal sentence))
Fun Fact: Stores have a competition to see who can spread your items across the most plastic shopping bags

Bag Packer: Here you go!
[[5 items placed in a single bag; heaviest item placed at the bottom]
Shopper: Thanks!

Bag Packer: Here you go!
[[Same items; heaviest item now placed in separate bag]]
Shopper: Oh, that's easier to carry.

Bag Packer: Here you go!
[[Heavy item is now double bagged]]
Shopper: Double-bagging the big stuff makes sense..

Bag Packer: Here you go!
[[the other 4 items are now split into 2 separate bags]]
Shopper: That's a bit wasteful..

Bag Packer: Here you go!
[[The 2 separate bags are now double bagged]]
Shopper: You just put five items in six bags.

Bag Packer: Here you go!
[[Every item is now in its own, double-bagged bag.]]
Shopper: OK! I give up! I'll buy a reusable bag!

Bag Packer: Here you go!
[[Reusable bag is double-bagged]]
Shopper: Augh!
