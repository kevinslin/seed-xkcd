![And if you drive a typical car more than a mile out of your way for each penny you save on the per-gallon price, it doesn't matter how worthless your time is to you--the gas to get you there and back costs more than you save.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/working.png)

## Transcript
[[A person is standing next to a petrol bowser filling their vehicle with petrol. They are being addressed by a different person, who is pointing off-screen.]]
Person 2 (talking to 1): Why are you going here? Gas is ten cents a gallon cheaper at the station five minutes that way.
Person 1 (pumping gas): Because a penny saved is a penny earned

((The caption below the panel reads: "If you spend nine minutes of your time to save a dollar, you're working for less than minimum wage."))
