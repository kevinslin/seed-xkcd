## Transcript
[[Classroom]]
Lecturer: And therefore, based on the existence of a Hamiltonian path, we can prove that the routing algorithm gives the optimal result in all cases.
Man: Oh my God.
[[Close-up of Man]]
(Out of frame): What? What is it?
Man: A sudden rush of perspective. What am I doing here? Life is so much bigger than this!

[[Man Running out of Room]]
Man: I have to go.
[[Man enters darkened room, where woman waits by window.]]
[[Man and woman embrace...]]

[[...and get into bed.]]
[[A heart appears over the supine bodies]]
Woman: Ohh...
[[Hands <<grip>>]]
Man (out of frame): Wait a moment.
Woman (out of frame): What is it?
[[Silence]]
Man (out of frame): His proof only holds if there's a Hamiltonian _cycle_ as well as a path!
Woman (out of frame): ...excuse me?
Man (out of frame): Paper, I need some paper.
Man (out of frame): Hey, do you mind if I jot down some notes on your chest?
