## Transcript
[[Two people walk along, one with light hair and a ponytail, another with shortish dark hair.]]
Ponytail: Why are people so comfortable handing Google and Facebook all this control over our lives?
Dark hair: I dunno. - Our species built thousands of nuclear weapons, scattered them around the planet, and then moved on to other things. - Maybe it's best to accept that some of this big-picture planning is just happening on autopilot.
