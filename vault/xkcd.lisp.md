## Transcript
[[Floating in space]]
Speaker: Last night I drifted off while reading a Lisp book.
Stick Figure Man: Huh?
Speaker: Suddenly, I was bathed in a suffusion of blue.
[[Floating in space before a vast concept tree]]
Speaker: At once, just like they said, I felt a great enlightenment.  I saw the naked structure of Lisp code unfold before me.
Stick Figure Man: My God
Stick Figure Man: It's full of 'car's
Speaker: The patterns and metapatterns danced.  Syntax faded, and I swam in the purity of quantified conception.  Of ideas manifest.
Truly, this was the language from which the gods wrought the Universe.
[[Floating in space with God appearing through a line of clouds]]
God: No, it's not.
Stick Figure Man: It's not?
God: I mean, ostensibly, yes.  Honestly, we hacked most of it together with Perl.
{{Alt Text: We lost the documentation on quantum mechanics.  You'll have to decode the regexes yourself.}}
