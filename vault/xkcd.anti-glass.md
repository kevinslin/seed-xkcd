## Transcript
[[Two police officers stand at an apartment door. The female officer is holding a pair of glasses with something attached to it. We will see later that Black Hat Guy is in the apartment]]
Female officer: Police. Open up. Did you make this glasses attachment?
Black hat guy {{through door}}: Oh, yeah. 

[[Black hat guy is sitting at his laptop.]]
Police officer: What's it do? 
Black hat guy: It detects when someone near you is wearing Google Glass and shines a laser pointer at their eyepiece.
Police officer: Why??
Black hat guy: The best defense is an indiscriminate offense. 

[[Cut back to officers outside the apartment.]]
Male officer: It seems you've mailed these devices to people across Silicon Valley, including the children of every Google executive. 
Black hat guy: Yeah. It's a viral marketing campaign for an upcoming movie. 

Male officer: What movie?
Black hat guy: haven't decided yet. Anything good coming out this fall?
Male officer: Sir, open the door. 
Black hat guy: First stare at the peephole for a sec.
