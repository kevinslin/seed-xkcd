![I get that there are security reasons for the schedule, but this is like the ONE problem we have where the right answer is both easy and straightforward. If we can't figure it out, maybe we should just give up and just replace all the portraits on the bills with that weird pyramid eye thing.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/women_on_20s.png)

## Transcript
[[Two figures stand, in silhouette, looking at a plane flying overhead.]]
Figure 1: What's that airplane? 
Figure 2: Oh, that's a Boeing Q404 twin-engine quad-band mig-380 hybrid dual-wield Mk. IVII turbodiesel 797 hydroplane.
I've always assumed I'm one of those people who knows a lot about planes, but I've never actually checked.

{{Title text: No, a hydroplane doesn't land on water--that's an aquaplane. A hydroplane is a plane that gets electric power from an onboard water reservoir with a tiny dam and turbines.}}
