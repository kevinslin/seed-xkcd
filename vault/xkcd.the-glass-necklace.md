## Transcript
[[A man is drawing a diagram of a cylinder with electrical terminals on either end]]
[[The man is shown at a workbench making the device in a workshop]]
[[He kneels down on a beach and scoops up sand]]
[[He pours the sand into the cylinder]]
[[He ties a spool of string to one end of the cylinder, and ties a deflated weather balloon to the other end]]
[[The weather balloon is inflated, and raised up into the clouds as thunder rumbles]]
[[The end of the string is tied to a stake in the ground, and lightning is flashing in the background]]
[[Lightning hits the balloon, travels through the cylinder, and fuses it's contents]]
{{Later}}
[[The man follows the string to find the cylinder]]
[[He detaches it, opens it, removes a solidified piece, and admires the piece]]
[[He takes the stone to a jeweler]]
[[The jeweler examines, grinds, and sets the now-shining stone in a necklace]]
[[The man approves of the final result]]
[[He gives it to a woman]]
