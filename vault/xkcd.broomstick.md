## Transcript
[[A woman in red slippers, Dorothy, stands talking to somebody off-screen.]]
Off-screen character: Bring me the broomstick of the wicked witch of the West and I'll take you home. 
Dorothy: Got it. 

[[The woman stands at the foot of a staircase talking to the off-screen wicked witch of the West.]]
Dorothy: You can have the slippers if you let me borrow your broom.
Wicked witch of the West: Deal.

[[Dorothy, now slipperless, walks along whistling with a broom over her shoulder.]]

[[Dorothy and another character are in a hot air balloon floating off the ground. Mountains are in the background. Looking on are the tin man, the lion, and a scarecrow.]]
Dorothy: That was easy.
