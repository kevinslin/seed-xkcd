## Transcript
[[Two cars are seen sitting at a red light. One person is seen walking from his car up to the driver of the car in front of him. The turn signals of both cars seem to be blinking at the same time.]]
Person in Street: Hey, our turn signals are in sync!
Person in Car: What the hell?
Person in Street: Usually they're at least a little off. But I've been watching like 30 seconds and haven't seen any beat frequency!
Person in Car: Who are you?
Person in Street: You know, from the beat frequency you can tell the difference in timing of the two signals.
Person in Car: ...
Person in Street: But ours are the same!
Person in Car: ...
Person in Street: So, wanna hang out later?
