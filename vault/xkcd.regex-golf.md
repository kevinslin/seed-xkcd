Meta-regex golf: 
Woman: So I wrote a program that plays regex golf with arbitrary lists...
Figure: Uh oh...

[[We zoom back out. The figure is facepalming. The woman is typing.]]
Meta-meta-regex golf: 
Woman: ...but I lost my code, so I'm grepping for files that look like regex golf solvers. 

[[We zoom back in.]]

Figure: Now you have infinite problems. 
Woman: No, I had those already.
