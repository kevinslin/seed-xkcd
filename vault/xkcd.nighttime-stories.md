## Transcript
[[ Man sitting in an armchair in a darkened room, behind him a bookshelf and an open window. A girl is seen outside reading a book by an eerie glow]]
For a few weeks now, sometime past midnight, a girl has wandered past my apartment reading by flashlight.
[[Outside, the girl, walking down the street passing under a street lamp]]
I wonder why she's up so late.
Maybe she's restless
Like me.
I wonder what story she's wrapped up in.
I wonder if she let's anyone into that island of light.
[[ Man sitting in dark room ]]
[[ Dark room minus man ]]
[[ Man standing on his doorstep at the top of a small flight of stairs, near the bottom of which the girl has stopped, no longer reading. ]]
Man: Hi!  What are you reading?
Girl: Orson Scott Card's 'Xenocide.'  It's my favorite in the series!
[[ The same, only man looks more dejected ]]
Man: Wait, you like it more than Speaker for the Dead OR Ender's Game?
Girl: Yeah!
[[ The same, only man has withdrawn ]]
[[ Man back sitting in the chair within dark apartment ]]
And to think I loved her.
