![I'd like to find a corpus of writing from children in a non-self-selected sample (e.g. handwritten letters to the president from everyone in the same teacher's 7th grade class every year)--and score the kids today versus the kids 20 years ago on various objective measures of writing quality. I've heard the idea that exposure to all this amateur peer practice is hurting us, but I'd bet on the generation that conducts the bulk of their social lives via the written word over the generation that occasionally wrote book reports and letters to grandma once a year, any day.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/writing_skills.png)

## Transcript
[[White Hat Guy and another guy are walking along. WHG is reading an article.]]
WHG: Weird - another study found that kids who use SMS abbreviations actually score 
higher
 on grammar and spelling tests.
Other guy: Why on 
earth
 is that a surprise?

[[Other guy expounds while an inset panel shows various kids throwing and catching balls while doing such things as walking the dog and eating lunch.]]
OG: Imagine kids start playing catch literally 
all the time
. Everywhere they go, they throw balls back and forth, toss them in the air, and hurl them at trees and signs - nearly every waking hour of their lives.

[[WHG starts to walk away.]]
OG:Do you think their generation will suck at baseball because they learned sloppy skills?
WHG: ...so you think someone will become a great writer while 
sexting
?

[[They both walk together.]]
OG: Have you 
read
 James Joyce's love letters? The phrases "my little fuckbird" and "arse full of farts" appear. If we want to write 
Ulysses
, our generation may not be sexting 
enough
. 
WHG: Eww.
