## Transcript
[[An adult and a child are standing around, looking at cellphones.]]
Child: Do you remember before the internet?
Adult: Oh yeah, totally.

[[The two look towards each other, no longer actively looking at their phones.]]
Child: What was it like?
Adult: Not having a phone or computer to distract you?
Child: Yeah.

[[Conversation continues.]]
Adult: It was SO. BORING. All the time. I just *sat* there. It was the *worst*.

[[Adult goes back to looking at phone.]]
Child: But wasn't it, like, more fulfilling? Engaging?
Adult: Wasn't worth it.
Child: I still get bored.
Adult: Not like we did.
