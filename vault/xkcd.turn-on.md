## Transcript
[[A bar]]
Man: So, the LHC's turning on. This could be our last night on earth.
Woman: Gimme a break. They're not even colliding yet, and it won't do anything cosmic rays haven't.
[[The man starts to turn away.]]
Woman: Hey, I didn't say no.
Woman: I'm a physics grad student. I need the excuse to party.
Man: So, you're up for a night with a charming stranger?
Woman: Depends. Top or bottom?
Man: Hey, I haven't even bought you a drink.
Woman: Barkeep, two whiskey sours, straight down.
