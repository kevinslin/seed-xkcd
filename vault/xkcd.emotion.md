## Transcript
[[A graph showing the approximate fractional causes of Randall's emotions, with percentages on the Y axis and time on the X axis.  "Politics", "Romance", "Code not working even though it *should* work", "people being wrong on the internet", and "other" all vary all throughout the time period from 2006 to midway 2010. There is a wedge of Joss Whedon that tapers out starting from 2006 to around mid 2007.  There is a noticeable increase in "Politics" around fall, 2008 that tapers off sharply afterwards and appears again in the second half on 2010, until..

Around approximately September 2010, everything else is compressed into a tiny fraction of around 2-3%.  The rest is filled with cancer.  The tiny wedge of everything does begin to slowly expand to be filled half with romance and half with an area filled with questionmarks]]
