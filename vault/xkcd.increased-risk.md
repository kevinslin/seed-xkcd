## Transcript
[[Three figures are standing around. Two have beach towels. A woman is looking at her cell phone. One of them is beret guy.]]
Woman: We should go to the north beach. Someone said the south beach has a 20% higher risk of shark attacks. 
Man: Yeah, but statistically, taking three beach trips instead of two increases our odds of getting shot by a swimming dog carrying a handgun in its mouth by 50%! 
Beret guy: Oh no! This is our third trip! 
Reminder: A 50% increase in a tiny risk is still tiny.
