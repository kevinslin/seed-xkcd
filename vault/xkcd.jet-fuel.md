![The 'controlled demolition' theory was concocted by the government to distract us. '9/11 was an inside job' was an inside job!](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/jet_fuel.png)

## Transcript
[[Two people are having a conversation.]]
Person 1: 9
11 was an inside job! Jet fuel can't burn hot enough to melt steel!
Person 2: Well, remember - jet fuel wasn't the only thing on those planes. They would've also carried tanks full of the mind-control agents airliners use to make chemtrails. Who 
knows
 what temperature that stuff burns at!
Person 1: Whoa. Good point!
