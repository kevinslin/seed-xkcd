## Transcript
[[Two people are standing next to each other having a conversation.]]
Person 1: My Mom's house burned down.
Person 2: Oh! I'm sorry!
Person 1: Why? It's not 
your
 fault.
Person 2: It's nice of you to say that, but I know what I did.

It annoys me when people interpret an obviously sympathetic "I'm sorry" as an apology, so I've started responding by making it one.
