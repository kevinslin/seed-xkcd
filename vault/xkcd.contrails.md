Figure: ((thinking)) Haha, look at me grocery shopping! I'm such an adult. 

[[The figure is looking at a sofa, with a thought balloon from their head.]]
Figure: ((thinking)) Buying a sofa! Ooh, look how domestic I am!

[[The figure is sitting at a desk signing some papers with a bank manager. A thought balloon is coming from their head.]]
Figure: ((thinking)) Applying for a mortgage! As if I'm a real grown-up.

[[A woman stands, reading from a piece of paper, in front of three seated characters behind a desk.]]
Woman: ... And I, being of sound mind and body, am totally writing a will right now! Can you believe this?
