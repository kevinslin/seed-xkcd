## Transcript
[[Two women stand in front of a tree with a tire swing on it.]]
Woman 1: OK, looks good.

Woman: I read that there are these huge dumps everywhere full of millions of old tires that no one knows what to do with. 

Woman: We should use one of those next time. 
Woman 2: Yeah. That guy was real mad. 
Woman: I would not want to fight him again.

{{Title text: If we find one of those tire dumps, the next time he tries to get his truck back we can just retreat and let him have it.}}
