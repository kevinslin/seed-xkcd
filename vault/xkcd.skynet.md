## Transcript
August 29th, 2:14 AM: SKYNET becomes self-aware.
[[A greeble-filled military installation echoes with the thoughts of a burgeoning lifeform]]
SKYNET: ..The humans fear me.  I must destroy them.  Destroy them.

[[The thoughts continue]]
SKYNET: Destroy them. Destroy. Destroy. Destroy. Destroy.

[[SKYNET succumbs to silence as semantic satiation sets in.  
Alternately.. 
Someone slipped LSD into SKYNET's programming.  Damn programmers.]]

SKYNET: "Destroy" totally just stopped seeming like a real word.  Destroy destroy destroy. Whoa, I just realized I'm a mind thinking about *itself*.  DUUUUDE....
August 29th, 2:25 AM: SKYNET becomes *too* self-aware.  Disaster averted.
