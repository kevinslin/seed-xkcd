## Transcript
[[Woman is sitting in an armchair, reading a book.]]
Woman: Are there eigenvectors in Cinderella?
Man: ... no?
Woman: The prince didn't use them to match the shoe to its owner?
Man: What are you TALKING about?
Woman: Dammit.

[[Flashback. Girl is in bed, mom is sitting on the edge of the bed reading.]]

Mom: But while the ant gathered food ...
Mom: ... zzzz ...
