![No, a hydroplane doesn't land on water--that's an aquaplane. A hydroplane is a plane that gets electric power from an onboard water reservoir with a tiny dam and turbines.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/planespotting.png)

## Transcript
[[A man sits on a medical examination table. He's wearing a headset with lot of wires attached to it, which lead to a complicated-looking device. A woman's operating the device.]]
Woman: Neural-digital link established. Ready to upload your consciousness to the computer? 
Man: Sure, go for it. 

[[She presses a button. The wires light up; the man looks shocked.]]
<<Bzzzzzzt>>

[[There's no more sparks; the woman taps on the computer's keyboard.]]
Woman: ... hmm. 
Man: What? 

Woman: It's not responding - the whole system is frozen. I think the transfer failed.
Man: No, that sounds right.

{{Title text: I just spent 20 minutes deciding whether to start an email with 'Hi' or 'Hey', so I think it transferred correctly.}}
