## Transcript
[[A lecturer is standing in front of a student at a desk.]]
Lecturer: Imagine that you're drawing at random from an urn containing fifteen balls--six red and nine black.
Student: Ok.  I reach in and... 
...My grandfather's ashes?!? Oh god!

Lecturer: I... what?
Student: 
Why would you do this to me?!?
