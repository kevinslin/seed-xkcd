## Transcript
[[A multiengine rocket sits on a launch pad.  Flight controllers monitor the launch.]]
Announcer: T-minus 2 minutes
Controller 1: Tank and booster are go for launch.
Controller 2: Safety console?
Controller 1: Check. Safety-
Controller 2: Wait.

[[Controller 2 notices an object flying past the rocket]]
Controller 1: What is it?
Controller 2: On the live feed- a cool bird just flew past the tower!

Controller 1: Whoa, hat kind?
Controller 2: Like a hawk, maybe!
Controller 1: Could it be a vulture?
Controller 2: I doubt it. The wings were flat, not in a "V".
Controller 1: It could be an eagle!
Controller 2: Ooh!

Controller 1: This is launch control. We have a possible sighting of a cool bird. Halt the countdown.
Controller 2: Someone get binoculars up here!
Controller 1: I want to see!
