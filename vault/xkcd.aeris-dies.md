## Transcript
[[Two men are talking.  The second man is sitting on the ground, hugging his knees to his chest]]
First Man: Maggie's gone. You can't bring her back.
Second Man: But I have to, she's a part of my life.
First Man: <<sigh>>
First Man: Okay, let me put this in your terms.
First Man: Remember when Aeris died in FFVII? It was sad, but you had to keep playing.
Second Man: Actually, I downloaded a mod to add her back to my party. It changed other character's appearances and dialogue to hers so you didn't have to lose her.
Second Man: Lots of gamers did it.
[[The first man put his hand on his chin]]
First Man: That is troubling on several levels.
Second Man: I wonder if Maggie's old dress would fit you.
