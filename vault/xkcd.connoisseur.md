## Transcript
[[A man in a white hat is standing with another man. They each hold a wine glass in one hand, in the man in the hat is holding a bottle of wine in the other. He looks at the label.]]
Hat man: How do you stand this cheap wine?
Man #2: Wine all tastes the same to me.

[[Close-up of Hat Man.]]
Hat man: You've just never had 
good
 wine. If you paid more attention, you'd realize there's a whole world here.

[[Close-up on the other man, who spreads his arms, sloshing his wine slightly.]]
Man #2: But that's true of 
anything!
 Wine, house music, fonts, ants, Wikipedia signatures, Canadian surrealist porn- spend enough time with any of them and you'll become a snobby connoisseur.]]

((This panel has no border and is next to but aligned further down than the first three panels.))
[[The full frame of the two characters again. Hat man now has the bottle at his side.]]
Hat man: But some things do have more depth than others.
Man #2: If you locked people in a box for a year with 500 still frames of Joe Biden eating a sandwich, by the end they'd be adamant that some were great and some were terrible.
Hat man: You're exaggerating.
Man #2: Oh yeah?

((This panel is below the others, and is indented about a third of the way to the right. It is wide.))
A YEAR LATER
[[A box. Voices emanate from inside.]]
Voice #1: Sure, most closed-mouth frames are boring, but in #415, the way the man's jaw frames the mayo on his hand is pure perfection, and--
Voice #2: What a surprise- 
you
 praising a mayo frame. Listening to you, I'd think there was nothing else in The Sandwich. -- Frankly, the light hitting J.B.'s collar through the lettuce would put #242 in my top ten even if he had 
no
 may on his hand at 
all
.
