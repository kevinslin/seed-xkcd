## Transcript
[[A single figure plods along alone, deep in thought.]]
Thought: There's no way that's true.
Thought: It would interfere with basic cognition.
Thought: Such a ridiculous view of masculinity.
Thought: How would you even STUDY that?

Caption: Every seven seconds, sociologists think about that made-up statistic about how often men think about sex.
