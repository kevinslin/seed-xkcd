![The graph is of the magnitude of the function with the real value between 0 and 2 and the imaginary between about 35 and 40.  I've misplaced the exact parameters I used.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/riemann-zeta.jpg)

## Transcript
[[A z=fn(x, y) plot, with pointy spikes on the back sloping to a relatively flat front.]]
Comment: You are like the prime numbers. Unpredictable turns, unconstrainable. Tantalizingly regular but never quite the same. I am like the Riemann-zeta function. A rippled curtain of the imagined and real. Deeply tied with you in ways incomprehensible. Although, strictly speaking, The Riemann-zeta function couldn't have given your herpes.
