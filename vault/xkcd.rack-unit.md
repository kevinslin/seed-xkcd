## Transcript
[[Black hat guy walks up to a woman sitting at a computer desk.]]
Black hat guy: I've discovered something.
Woman: Oh?

[[We see a close-up of black hat guy's face.]]
Black hat guy: Standard server rack units and standard beehive honeycomb frames are compatible. They're both 19 inches, with similar pitches.
Woman: Uh oh.

[[The woman has turned round in her chair to look at black hat guy.]]
Black hat guy: I'm pleased to announce that today, for a few hours, Google led the world in datacenter honey production. Until their security people kicked me out.

[[The woman turns back to her computer, while black hat guy walks off.]]
Woman: I'm sorry your beekeeping career ended so quickly.
Black hat guy: I'll find a new datacentre. Turns out most colocation TOSes don't mention beehives.
Woman: I suspect that will soon change.
