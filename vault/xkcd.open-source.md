## Transcript
[[A man with much facial hair is sleeping on a bed.]]
[[Suddenly, two ninjas jump through the skylight.]]
Ninja 1: Richard Stallman! Your viral open source licenses have grown too powerful.
Ninja 1: The GPL must be stopped.
Ninja 1: At the source.
Ninja 1: You.
[[Richard Stallman wakes up immediately, and pulls his katana out of its sheath from under his bed]]
Richard Stallman: Hah! Microsoft lackeys! So it has come to this!
Richard Stallman: A night of blood I've long awaited. But be this my death or yours, free software will carry on! For a GNU dawn! For freedom! ... hey, where are you going?
[[The ninja step out the window]]
Ninja 1: Man, you're right, that never gets old.
Ninja 2: Let's do Eric S. Raymond next.
Ninja 1: Or Linus Torvalds. I hear he sleeps with nunchucks.
[[Comic alt text: Later we'll dress up like Big Oil thugs and jump Ralph Nader.]]
