## Transcript
[[The first panel's scenery is upside down.  An artist is hanging from the ground, looking down at the sky, where there is a cloud.]]
Artist: Oh -- hello down there!
Artist: Welcome to my sky!

[[The artist is now standing on the ground looking up.]]
Artist: It's pretty good.
Artist: I like it.
Artist: It's not the same color as 
anything
.

[[The scene zooms out, revealing more clouds.]]
Artist: Wow!
Artist: There are a 
lot
 of you!
Artist: Good thing it's so big.

[[A figure with long hair is talking to the artist at what's evidently an alcoholory, since the figure is holding a martini glass and there is a waiter in the background.]]
Figure: And what do 
you
 do?
Artist: I'm in the cloud storage business.
