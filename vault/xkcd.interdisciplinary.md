## Transcript
[[2 men and 1 woman stand in the foreground, while in the background, a woman stands on a platform and releases a pendulum hanging from the ceiling toward a man who is running away.]]

Man #2: This is an interdisciplinary program in which Physics students try to hit Psychology students with pedulums. 
Woman: Promising!
Background man: AAAAAAA!

My professors had an ongoing competition to get the weirdest thing taken seriously under the label "interdisciplinary program."
