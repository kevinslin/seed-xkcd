## Transcript
[[Black hat guy stands halfway up a stepladder, holding a heavy-looking ball attached to the ceiling with a rope. Another figure stands below in its path.]]

{{Title text: The laws of physics are fun to try to understand, but as an organism with incredibly delicate eyes who evolved in a world full of sharp objects, I have an awful lot of trust in biology's calibration of my flinch reflex.}}
