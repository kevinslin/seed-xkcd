## Transcript
[[It is black, except a few blue and green lights, and red numbers from a clock. The clock shows 4:31]]
Lying awake at night
I realize how many little lights there are in my room.
The alarm clock is the brightest.
Can't sleep
I'm alone with those glowing red numbers
[[The clock now shows 4:32]]
Time slows
Does time even exist here?
Thoughts churning in on themselves
[[The clock nows shows 4:33]]
The madness can't be far away
Ah yes
[[The clock now shows 13:72]]
There it is.
