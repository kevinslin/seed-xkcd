## Transcript
[[There is one human in the panel.  The human points at their chest.]]
Human: I just have one tattoo - it's six dots on my chest, done by my oncologist.

Human: I need them for aligning the laser sights on a flesh-searing relativistic particle cannon,

Human: So it will only kill the parts of me

[[Dramatic zoom, the panel background is black, with white text.]]
Human: That are holding me back.

[[The panel is larger, revealing who they're talking to.]]
Human: But your barbed wire bicep tattoo is pretty hardcore, too!
Dejected: No, it's OK.  I'll just go put a shirt on.
