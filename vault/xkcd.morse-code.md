Person 1: When the French navy retired Morse code in 1997, they broadcast a final message: - 
"Calling all. This is our last cry before our eternal silence."


[[They sit in silence for a moment.]]

[[The first person puts their hand to their chin.]]
Person 1: I wonder if I can find my Livejournal login.
