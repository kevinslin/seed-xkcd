## Transcript
[[Two women and a man are standing around, talking.]]
Woman: Our lab is studying a fungus that takes over mammal brains and makes them want to study fungi.
Man: It's very promising! We're opening a whole new wing of the lab just to cultivate it!

{{Title text: Conspiracy theory: There's no such thing as corn. Those fields you see are just the stalks of a fungus that's controlling our brains to make us want to spread it.}}
