## Transcript
[[The scene is a party.  Two characters are talking - the entirety of the text is a thought bubble of one of the two.]]
Thinker:  Am I smiling enough?  Should I be leaning on something?  Where should my hands go?  I hope he doesn't ask me what his name is.  I've said "yeah" too much; what are some other agreeing words?  Oh crap, his story just got sad 
stop smiling stop smiling
