Title: Predicting the success or failure of a new product, based on what engineers and programmers are saying about it.

If they say it doesn't do anything new, or why would anyone want that: it means the product will be a gigantic success.

If they say it's really exciting! or I've already preordered one: the product will be a flop. years later, its ideas will show up in something successful.

If they say wait, are you talking about <unfamiliar person's name>'s new project?: the product could be a scam and may result in arrests or lawsuits.

If they say I would never put <company> in charge of managing my <whatever>: within five years, they will.
