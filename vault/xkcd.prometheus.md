!['I'm here to return what Prometheus stole.' would be a good thing to say if you were a fighter pilot in a Michael Bay movie where for some reason the world's militaries had to team up to defeat every god from human mythology, and you'd just broken through the perimeter and gotten a missile lock on Mount Olympus.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/prometheus.png)

## Transcript
[[3 figures are seen. Figure A is addressing Figure B, who just walked in-panel. Figure A points at Prometheus. Prometheus is looking ponderous and holding a flaming torch.]]
Figure A: Prometheus has stolen fire from the Gods! 
Prometheus: Well, sort of. I mean, when you use a fire to make another fire, the first fire doesn't go away. So really, it's more like sharing.
Fire wants to be free.
