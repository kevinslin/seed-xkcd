## Transcript
[[Man is holding a box with an open lid. A miniature piano is inside. The girl is looking at it]]
Man: My hobby is making miniatures. Check this out-- it's a fully-functional grand piano.
Woman: Woah - beautiful.
[[Man looks at the miniature piano]]
Man: Sadly, I've never head what proper music sounds like on it-the keys are too small to play.
[[Man closes lid to the piano.]]
Man: I once asked a genie for someone who could play it for me, but I think he misheard.
Girl: ... are you doing anything later?
{{Alt-Text: Good thing he didn't make it smaller, or it'd need someone three inches tall to play it.}}
