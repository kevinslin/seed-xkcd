## Transcript
[[Two people stand at an open refrigerator.]]
1: What do you drink? Stouts? Lagers?
2: Uh, anything's fine.

[[Person 1 is drinking from a bottle while Person 2 holds his in his hand.]]
2: ...do you ever think maybe we should just admit that all beer tastes kind of bad and everyone's just pretending?

[[Person 2 drinks from his bottle and Person 1 holds his.]]
1: Man, you are no fun at all.
2: Ok, got it. Not a word.
1: Dude, if you don't like it, don't drink it.
2: No, no, gotta do my part! - Mmmmm!!!
