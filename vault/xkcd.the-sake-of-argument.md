{{Title text: 'It's not actually ... it's a DEVICE for EXPLORING a PLAUSIBLE REALITY that's not the one we're in, to gain a broader understanding about it.' 'oh, like a boat!' '...' 'Just for the sake of argument, we should get a boat! You can invite the Devil, too, if you want.'}}

[[Woman talking to a man]]
Woman: Just for the sake of argument, let's say that--
Man: -- wait, for the sake of what?

[[Zoom in on man]]
Woman ((off scene)): Argument.
Man: Ok, cool, that's totally a good reason to say something that's wrong.  Gotta have arguments.

[[Zoom out to original scene]]
Woman: I'm just playing devil's advocate.
Man: Ok. So you saw an argument where one side was the devil, and you were like "man, that guy could use an advocate."

[[Zoom out and in silhouette]]
Woman:  It's... why are you being so difficult?
Man: For the sake of argument.
Woman: Argh!
Man: Yay, it's working!
