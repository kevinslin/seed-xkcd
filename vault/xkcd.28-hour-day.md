## Transcript
[[There is a diagram which shows the hours in a week. It has sections labeled "bed" and below has sections labeled "night." They do not line up.]]
[[Two men are talking together.]]
First man: You have trouble sleeping right?
Second man: Only when your mom is over.
[[First man is now pointing to a chart.]]
First man: Since your work is flexible-
Second Man: -Like your mom-
First Man: -you should try the 28-hour day - 20 awake, 8 asleep (or 19
9 if you prefer).
Second Man: I prefer your mom.
First Man: It synchs up with the week - you spend weekdays awake normally, then on weekends you can go out all night.
Second Man: Just like your mom.
First Man: It means four extra hours daily. You can stay up until you're exhausted every day and then spend a full 9 hours asleep each night!
Second Man: But how much time can I spend doing your mom?
First Man: You? I'm guessing three or four minutes, tops.
Second Man: ...Well played.
