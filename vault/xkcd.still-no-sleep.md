## Transcript
[[Woozy person walks and speaks.]]
Person: The sleep deprivation madness worsens.

[[Person examines hands.]]
Person: Things seem unreal. Am I even awake? Maybe I'm dreaming.

[[Person approaches a tree with a squirrel on it.]]
Person: I'm pretty sure I'm hallucinating this tree.

Person: But what if I'm hallucinating that I'm hallucinating, and I'm actually totally sane?
Squirrel: Listen.
Squirrel: I wouldn't worry about that.
