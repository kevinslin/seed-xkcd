## Transcript
I spend a lot of time mentally choreographing elaborate fight scenes with strangers around me.
[[Man is in a post office wearing earphones.  There are several other people, including an old man with a crutch and an old woman with a long narrow box]]
Man's thoughts: Okay - if that old man pulls a crossbow,
Man's thoughts: I'll throw the postal scale at him and dive backward behind the stamps machine.
Man's thoughts: But what if the lady by the door has a katana in that box?
Man's thoughts: Better set my iPod to the "Kill Bill" fight theme, just in case.
