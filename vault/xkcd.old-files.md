## Transcript
[[A cutaway view of a "ground" which is actually made up of layers labeled with various groups of files as one might see on a random person's computer fills the frame, such as "Documents, 47 GB" and "High School Zip Disk, 94 MB". A small crevice leads down through the middle, to a cave-like area where a figure stands looking through the smallest grouping of files. A second figure with long hair stands at ground level, looking down into the crevice.]]
Long-haired Figure: You okay down there?
Subterranean Figure: Oh my god. I wrote *poetry*.
