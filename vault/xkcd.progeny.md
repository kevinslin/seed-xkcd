## Transcript
[[A guy sits at a computer; a woman stands behind him.]]

Guy: Wow -- researchers taught a computer to beat the world's best humans at yet ANOTHER task. Does our species have ANYTHING left to be proud of?
Woman: Well, it sounds like we're pretty awesome at teaching.
Guy: Huh? What good is THAT?
