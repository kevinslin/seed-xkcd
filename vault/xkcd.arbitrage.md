## Transcript
[[Two figures sit at a table. One of them is aghast while the other cheerfully shuttles chips from a bowl on the table to a giant sack of CHIPS.]]

Chip thief: THEY'RE the ones giving chips away! If they don't see the arbitrage potential, sucks for them.

Caption: In a deep sense, society functions only because we generaly avoid taking these people to dinner.
