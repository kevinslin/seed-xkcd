## Transcript
When I have a boring task to get through -- a three-hour lecture, a giant file download, or a long term point goal in fitocracy -- I use this formula to convert the percentage completed (p) into a date:

T=(Current Date) - (e^(20.344p^3) - e^3) years

When the task is 0% done, it gives today's date, and as I make progress, I move further and further back in time

((inverse given in lighter colors))
Inverse: p = sqrt((ln(T+e^3)-3)
(20.3444))

[[Line Graph explaining the correlation between completion percentages and temporal deltas.
0% = now ((Date of comic is 2012-02-14T00:00-0500, approx. 1329195600 UNIX))
10% = September 2011
20% = 2008
30% = 1997
40% = 1958
50% = 1776
60% = 405 AD
70% = 22,000 years ago
80% = 671,000 years ago
90% = 55 million years ago
100% = 13.8 billion years ago
]]

It moves slowly through the first few years, then steadily accelerates. I tuned the formula so the time spent in each part of the past is loosely proportional to how well I know it. This means I hit familiar landmarks with each bit of progress, giving me a satisfying sense of movement.

((The following are panels detailing completion percentages, correlated time periods, and notable events from this time period))

[[Person 1 watches a download progress on a laptop in amazement and happiness.  Person 2 stands nearby and looks at person 1 with a bemused posture]]
Person 1: Swoosh! Watching all that time blur past is such a rush!
Person 2: So... you've tried to make an extreme sport out of.. *waiting*.
Person 1: Swoosh!
