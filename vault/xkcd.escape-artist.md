## Transcript
[[One man sits before a computer on a desk while another stands behind him.]]
Standing Man: I was fascinated by locks as a kid. I loved how they turned information and patterns into physical strength.
Sitting Man: Why does my script keep dying?
[[Closeup of the man on the man sitting at the computer]]
Standing Man: And a lock invites you to try and open it. It's the hacker instinct. Only your ignorance stands in the way.
Sitting Man: Wait it's passing bad strings.
[[Returns to the two shot of both men]]
Standing Man: I admired Harry Houdini, how he could open any lock and free himself from any restraint. 
Sitting Man: Ah - Bash is parsing the spaces.
Standing Man: Sure some of it was fakery and showmanship. But I still wonder how he so consistently escaped handcuffs.
Sitting Man: Backslashes
Standing Man: Huh?
Sitting Man: Never mind.
