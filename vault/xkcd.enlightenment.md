{{Title text: But the rules of writing are like magic spells. If you never acquire them, then not using them says nothing.}}

[[Two Internet Bodhisattvas lecture a pupil encircled by a wheel placed upon the ground.]]
Boddhisatva 1: To achieve *Internet Enlightenment*, you must free yourself from insecurity. 
Novice: But insecurity keeps me humble!

Boddhisatva 1: No. Insecurity leads to conceit.  Conceit leads to judgment.  Judgment leads to being an asshole.

[[A laptop is placed on a stand in front of the student]]
Novice: I'm ready, How do I begin?
Boddhisatva 1: Type this sentence: "I heard you're idea's and their definately good"

[[The laptop has been smashed to the floor.  The circle, one full of hope and excitement, is now full of despair and no students]]
Boddhisatva 1: She wasn't ready.
Boddhisatva 2: Its a difficult road.
