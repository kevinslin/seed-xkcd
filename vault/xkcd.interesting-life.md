[[On the left hand side of the panel is a cutaway of several floors of an office, in gray.  On the right side a blue sky with clouds, and green hills.  Hanging from a cable is a GIRL, clearly having rappelled down the side of the building]]
GIRL: You know how some people consider "May you have an interesting life" to be a curse?
GUY IN OFFICE: Yeah...
GIRL: Fuck those people.  Wanna have an adventure?
