## Transcript
[[A woman sits at her computer, a man standing behind her. The woman speaks first.]]
Woman: Another ISP's filtering content.
Man: Thank God for Crypto.
[[The man stands alone; the woman is presumably off-panel left.]]
Man: It wasn't that long ago that RSA was illegal to export. Classified a munition.
[[The woman, sitting in her chair, is looking back towards the man, presumably off-panel right.]]
Woman: You know, I think the crypto community took the wrong side in that fight. We should've lobbied to keep it counted as a weapon.
Man: Why?
[[She is now turned around in the chair looking at the man, who is in-panel again.]]
Woman: Once they get complacent, we break out the second amendment.
[[The man has his hand on his chin, contemplatively.]] 
Man: ...Damn.
