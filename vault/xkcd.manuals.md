## Transcript
[[A horizontal line has four points labeled on it, with the second point from the left marked with a dashed vertical line dividing the horizontal line into two parts. An arrow labeled "Solve problems" points left from the vertical line. An arrow labeled "Create problems" points right from the vertical line. The points are labeled, from left to right, "Tools that don't need a manual", "Tools that need a manual", "Tools that need a manual but don't have one", and "Tools whose manual starts with 'how to read this manual'".]]
