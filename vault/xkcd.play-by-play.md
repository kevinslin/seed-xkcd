## Transcript
[[Beret Guy is most definitely sitting at a desk, in what may or may not be an announcer's box.  Beret Guy has what may or may not be an active headset with microphone on under his hat.]]
Beret Guy: For those just joining us, hi! We're on part 5 of a hitting game.

Beret Guy: The next guy has a big bat, so he'll probably hit the ball real far.   huh?
{{
-
Wait- he missed! 
-
Oh good, they're letting him try again.

Beret Guy: The people sitting on the chair shelves are yelling at this guy, but he's ignoring them. Wow. 
-
Rude.

Beret Guy: This thrower is good! He keeps making people leave by throwing balls at them. 
-
It's just him though. None of his teammates are joining in.

Beret Guy: That guy just ran to the second pillow when no one was looking! 
-
Everyone's real mad but I guess they checked the rules and there's nothing that says he can't do that.  
-
Yikes. Hopefully they can fix that once this game is over.
