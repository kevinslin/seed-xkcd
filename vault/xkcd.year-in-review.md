![All in all, I give this year a C-. There were no aurora visible from my house and that comet evaporated. They'd better not cancel the 2017 eclipse.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/year_in_review.png)

## Transcript
[[A newscaster sits in a studio, with an inset reporter on the scene.]]
Newscaster: We go live to our 2013: Year in review!
On-the-scene reporter: Thanks! In 2013, I didn't see an aurora.
Newscaster: I- what?

On-the-scene reporter: The northern lights. I thought this would finally be the year. But it didn't happen. 

Newscaster: Oh. Uh... what about the rest of the year? 
On-the-scene reporter: What do you mean? 
Newscaster: Any big news stories? 
On-the-scene reporter: Oh yeah, tons. 

[[The inset reporter looks off screen. The newscaster looks at her.]]

Newscaster: ... Well, that was 2013: Year in review.
On-the-scene reporter: The sky's clearing up. I'll be outside.
