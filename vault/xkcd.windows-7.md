## Transcript
[[A girl is standing behind a guy sitting at a desk using his laptop]]
Girl: What are you doing?
Guy: Trying the Windows 7 beta.
Girl: Why is it showing a picture of Hitler?
[[The laptop's screen is shown with Adolph Hitler's face on it]]
Guy: I don't know.  I can't get it to do anything else.
Girl: There's no UI?
Guy: No, just Hitler.
[[Return to the original scene, except the girl is now scratching her head in confusion]]
Girl: Did you try Ctrl-Alt-Delete?
Guy: It just makes Hitler's eyes flash.
Girl: Huh.
[[Scene remains basically the same, except the girl is no longer scratching her head and the guy is no longer typing on the laptop]]
Girl: Well, it's better than Vista.
Guy: True.
