![Hey, it says here that if you dream about your teeth falling out, it means they're spreading.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/brain_worms.png)

## Transcript
[[A woman sits at a computer desk, and a man stands near her holding a book.]]
Man: Weird--this parasitic worm infects the brain, damaging the areas responsible for spatial reasoning in dreams. Signs of infection include dreams about not fitting in your car comfortably, driving from the backseat, or veering all over the road.
Woman: (thinking) Oh God.

My Hobby: Taking advantage of the fact that some specific dreams are weirdly common, but not everyone who has them realizes this.
