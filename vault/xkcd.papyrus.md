## Transcript
My Hobby:
Getting typography geeks heartfelt cards printed in "papyrus" and watching them struggle to act grateful.
Woman: Thank you for the <<Twitch>> ... lovely... <<Twitch>> birthday card!
[[The woman is holding a card open and looking at someone.  An angry tic is flicking on her forehead.]]
