## Transcript
((One panel, depicting three wavy circles. The one in the center is slightly larger, and the ones on either side are higher up. Their edges are touching.))

[[The left circle has Bruce Wayne in the foreground, with Alfred in the background.]]
Alfred: Know your limits, Master Wayne.
Bruce: A man dressed like a bat 
has
 no limits.

[[The center circle has a close-up on Batman in his cowl.]]
Someone off-screen: 
What the hell are you?

Batman: I'm a man dressed like a bat.

[[In the right circle is The Joker.]]
Off-screen: 
What do you propose?

Joker: It's simple - we kill a man dressed like a bat.

My Hobby: Whenever anyone says "Batman," I mentally replace it with "a man dressed like a bat."
