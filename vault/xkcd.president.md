## Transcript
[[A large person is talking to a small person, who is presumably young.]]
Large: I can't imagine anyone who grew up on the Internet being able to run for President.

Small: Why?
Small: Because it'd mark the handover of a world that no longer needs you to a generation you don't understand?

Small: ... or because there would be embarrassing pictures of us as teenagers?

Large: Um.
Large: The pictures one?
Small: Pictures of teens!  How will we even survive?
