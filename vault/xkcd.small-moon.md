## Transcript
[[The exterior of the Millennium Falcon, watching as an Imperial Fighter approaches the Death Star in the distance. Voices from inside...]]
Luke: He's heading for that small moon.
Obi-Wan: That's no moon - it's a space station.

[[The same view.]]
Luke: It's too big to be a space station.
Obi-Wan: But it's too 
small
 to be a moon. 

[[Three hours pass]]

[[The Millennium Falcon in side view.]]
Obi-Wan: Fine! What if we agree it's not a moon, but we make a new category called "dwarf moon"?
Luke: And what's the cutoff, asshole?! Is this 
ship
 a dwarf moon now?
Obi-Wan: Screw you.
