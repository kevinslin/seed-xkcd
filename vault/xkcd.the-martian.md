![I have never seen a work of fiction so perfectly capture the out-of-nowhere shock of discovering that you've just bricked something important because you didn't pay enough attention to a loose wire.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/the_martian.png)

## Transcript
[[White Hat Guy comes up behind Stickman while he is sitting at a desk looking at a laptop.]]
SM: Ooh, trailer for 
The Martian
! 
WHG: What's that?
SM: Movie of a book I liked.
WHG: Should I read it?

[[Stickman turns around in his chair to face White Hat Guy.]]
SM: Depends. You know the scene in Apollo 13 where the guy says "we have to figure out how to connect 
this
 thing to 
this
 thing using 
this
 table full of parts or the astronauts will all die?"
WHG: Yeah?

[[Stickman turns back to the laptop.]]
SM: 
The Martian
 is for people who wish the whole movie had just been more of that scene.
WHG: How on earth did 
that
 become a big-budget thing with Matt Damon?
SM: No idea, but I'm 
so
 excited.
