## Transcript
[[Two guys and a girl are standing in a room, the first guy holds a keyboard.]]
First guy: Hey, help me test the Transconsciousness Messaging Protocol.
Second guy: What's that?
First guy: I've been training myself to keep my fingers moving slightly as I fall asleep, so I can type from inside dreams.
[[First guy sitting on his bed]]
First guy: I'm going to sleep now. My computer will relay my messages to you as I explore the dream world.
[[In the dream: (first guy standing in what looks like a forest.)]]
First guy: So strange to think none of this is real. And yet I have this lifeline to the internet back home.
First guy: A chance to speak from one reality to another. I feel like Bell & Watson. I get to write the inaugural TCMP message. Let's see... [[types on the keyboard]]
[[outside: (girl sitting at a computer, second guy standing behind her)]]
Girl: "F1rst p√∏st!!"?
Second guy: Great. He's jumped straight to transreality trolling.
