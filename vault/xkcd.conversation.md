## Transcript
[[A figure and a woman sit facing each other at a dining table with glasses of wine and a candle on it.]]
Figure: So, what do you do in your free time? 

[[We see the woman in close-up.]]
Woman: Mostly I sit around worrying someone will ask me that, and try to think of a good answer. 

[[We see both at the table again. The woman gets up to go.]]
Figure: That's not a bad answer. 
Woman: It's all I've got. Now that it's done, I should go. Bye!
