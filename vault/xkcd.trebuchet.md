## Transcript
[[A man is working on something on a table, and a woman is sitting at a computer]]
Man: The trebuchet is almost done!
Woman: Mm.
Man: The range should be over 150 meters.
Girl: Look - I'm sure it's a cool project.
[[Picture of a trebuchet]]
Girl: But eventually you'll need to outgrow these toys, and focus your energy on something practical.  This mad science is getting out of hand.
Man: Says the girl who mounted an auto-targeting kilowatt laser on the roof.
Girl: That's practical! It keeps the squirrels off the feeder!
