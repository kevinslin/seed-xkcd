## Transcript
Now and then, I announce "I know you're listening" to empty rooms.
[[Man is sitting in an armchair, reading.  He murmurs something.]]
[[Second man in front of a large computer terminal jumps out of chair after hearing the first man mumble. His chair has fallen over]]
If I'm wrong, no one knows.  And if I'm right, maybe I just freaked the hell out of some secret organization.
