## Transcript
[[Weird root vegetables surround a strange script.]]

[[Woman holding up book.]]
Woman: This is the Voynich manuscript -- a book, allegedly 500 years old, written in an unrecognized script.  It's some kind of visual encyclopedia of imaginary plants and undeciphered "recipes".

[[The man opens the book.]]
Woman: It could be a hoax, a lost language, a cipher, an alien text, glossolatia -- no one knows.
Man: No one? But it's obvious.

Woman: ... Obvious?  Linguists and cryptographers have been stumped for decades.
Man: They forget. Human nature doesn't change.

Man: Just imagine someone found a book from _our_ time, full of lists, illustrations, tables, and long, dry descriptions of nonexistent worlds written in an invented language.  What have they found?
Woman: ... Dear Lord. It 
is
 obvious.

500 Years Earlier:
[[Three people are standing around pawns and a die.  One is holding a sheet of paper, another is holding a book, the third is holding a scythe.]]
Person #1: Forsooth! I concoct an elixir of courage.
Person #2: Nae! The source booke sayeth that requires some wolfsbane!
Person #3: Your druid doth lose two points.
