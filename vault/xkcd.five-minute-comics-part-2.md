## Transcript
Because of a family illness, instead of regular comics, this week I'll be sharing some strips that I drew as part of a game I played with friends.  Each comic had to be written and drawn in five minutes.

    -- Randall

((A series of comics are arrayed haphazardly.  They will be tackled top to bottom, left to right, approximately.  Strips will be separated by two new lines.))

[[A ninja is hiding under a diving board as a man runs along it.]]

[[The man jumps on the end of the board and hits the ninja in the head, knocking him into the pool.]]

[[The ninja floats in the water.  A bullet passes through the man's head.]]
<<thwipp>>

[[The man is lying bleeding on the diving board, the ninja is still unconscious on the pool.]]

[[A sniper is at the top of a hill.  The sign in front of the hill says "Grassy Knoll".]]

[[Someone is pointing at the diagram of the previous panel.]]
Off-panel voice: Wait, so 
what
 does this have to do with 9
11, again?
Person: I 
said
 I'm 
getting
 there!


[[A man is studying a woman.]]
Man: You look different.

Man: You have this... _glow_ about you.

[[They stare in silence.]]

[[A baby falls out of the woman.]]
<<plop>>


Woman: Cogito ergo cogito.
Off-panel voice: Playing it safe, huh?


[[Two ghosts are standing in front of a woman at a door, each carrying a bag.  They are children dressed up.]]
Children: Trick or treat!

[[The woman doesn't move.]]

Child: Um hi.  Why are you just standing there?
Other Child: Candy?

[[Another silent panel as the children stare up at the woman.]]

[[The second child looks in their bag.]]
Other Child: Oh God, my bag of candy.

Other Child: It's filling with blood.
Child: We should go.


[[A jet is flying across the panel.]]
Pilot: Bail out! Bail out! Bail out!

[[The pilot and copilot have buckets, and are bailing water out of the cockpit.]]


The following is a dramatization of real events.

[[A person is at a counter, with several jars.]]
Person: AAAAAAAAAAAAA I'm making a sandwich! AAAAAAAAAA!


[[Two people are carrying lightsabers and wearing robes.]]
Person: Oh God.  My eyes won't focus right! And your robe looks... really dirty!

My blacklightsaber was not a success.


[[A person is standing.]]
Person: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.
Off-screen voice: It seems we happen to be all ladies, actually.
Person: ... in that case, this defense is going to appear _extremely_ ill-advised.


[[Darth Vader is sitting between two people, at a table.]]
Person: Your sad devotion to that ancient religion hasn't hleped you conjur up the stolen data tapes, or given you --
Darth Vader: 
Hey.
  Wicca is a legitimate belief system!

[[Darth Vader is drawing a pentagram on the table.]]
Person: What are you --
Darth Vader: Putting a _hex_ on your family.
