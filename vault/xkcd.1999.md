## Transcript
[[Inverted intro panel]] 
It's easy to forget, as we heap awards on The Social Network,
That before there was Facebook, MySpace, or even Friendster...
One website dreamed bigger than them all.

[[Two guys talking]]
Guy #1: People like doing stuff, so why not build a website that offers that?
Guy #2: Offers what? What would I do there?
Guy #1: Anything!  The only limit is yourself!

[[Guy runs in.  Two guys are by a computer, one sitting at it wearing headphones.]]
Guy running in: Hey, we need more--
Standing guy: Don't--he's wired in.
Guy at computer: THE INFINITE IS POSSIBLE.
Standing guy: Or baked. It's hard to tell.

[[Two guys are sitting at a restaurant booth.]]
Guy #1: It's time to monetize. We could make millions!
Guy #2: No way. A million dollars isn't cool. You know what's cool?
Guy #1: A billio--
Guy #2: CIRCLES.

[[View from booth of a guy leaving, turning back to say something.]]
Guy: HeyÂ—a tip: Drop the dot.  Just "Zombocom". It's cleaner.
