## Transcript
[[A person is picking through various items of trash or recycling on a conveyor belt.  A juice bottle, emty cardboard box, opened tin can, bottlecap, crumpled and flat sheets of paper, a soda or pop can, and miscellaneous junk are visible.]]
Person: This guy tears the labels off his cans, so he clearly understands they're going to be sorted somewhere - 
Person: Yet in the same batch he includes a bottle with like an ounce of congealed juice in it.
Person: What an asshole.
I worry a lot about what the people at the recycling center think of me.
