## Transcript
[[Randall
xkcd
man and Nathan Fillion are ready on the start line on their electric skateboards]]
Voice off panel: On your mark...
Voice: Get set...
Nathan: Remember episode 11, when I got all naked in that desert?
Voice: Go!
[[Nathan speeds away leaving Randall standing at the start line]]
voice: ... I said "Go."
voice: someone throw some water on him
Randall: Can't...get it...out of my head...
[[Nathan on walkie talkie, speeding on his skateboard]]
Nathan: He's right behind me. Kaylee, I'm gonna try a Crazy Ivan.
Kaylee [[on walkie talkie]]: That doesn't make any sense, Nathan.
Nathan: Trust me.
Kaylee: No, I mean it's not a skateboard maneuver[sic]. The concept doesn't even apply to this situation.
Nathan [[via walkie talkie]]: That's why it just might work!
Kaylee: No, that's the opposite of true!
Nathan: On my mark, override the remote differential and throw her into a spin.
Kaylee [[via walkie talkie]] okay, but-
Nathan: Mark!
<<WHAM>>
[[Nathan lying injured on the ground next to his skateboard, Randall
Man cruises past]]
<<Whirrrrrrrr>>
[[Nathan, trying to stand up]]
Nathan: I'm down. Tell Summer "The chickens are in the hayloft. Plan Gamma is a go."
[[Nathan, one foot on skateboard, looking at walkie talkie]]
<<mumbling from walkie talkie>>
Kaylee: She says, "Plan gamma acknowledged. The meerkats are in the bad.
[[Summer Glau is walking off panel]]
Kaylee [[to walkee talkie]]: So we're good?
Nathan: Hard to tell with her. Do you see an actual bag of meerkats?
Kaylee: No.
Nathan: Then we're probably good.
[[Randall
Man screeching to a halt as he sees Summer Glau]]
Randall: Oh! Hi, Miss Glau! I'd love to talk, but Nathan's back on his feet and catching up.
[[Summer grabs Randalls arm]]
<<Grab>>
Randall: Wha-
[[Summer kicks Randall in the face whilst pulling his arm towards her, he flies off his skateboard]]
[[Summer walking away as Randall lies crippled on the floor with his sunglasses beside him]]
[[Randall still lying on the floor]]
Randall [[thinking]]: I've never been so turned on in my life.
