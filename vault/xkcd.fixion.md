## Transcript
A guide to the medical diagnostic and treatment algorithm used by IBM's Watson computer system.

[[Chart consists of highly complex flowchart, with some states having labeled transition functions, and others having unconditional transitions.  Transitions will be placed after the state names for this description]]

Start
-> Draw Blood

Draw Blood
-> Record Patient's Name

Record Patient's Name
-> Measure Patient's Height and Weight

Measure Patient's Height and Weight
-> Consult Standard Height
Weight Chart

Consult Standard Height
Weight Chart
-> Surgically Adjust Patient To Match

Surgically Adjust Patient To Match
-> Is Patient Coughing Up Blood?

Is Patient Coughing Up Blood?
Yes -> Gather Blood And Return It To Body
No -> Is Patient Still Here?

Gather Blood And Return It To Body
-> Record Pulse Rate

Is Patient Still Here?
Yes -> Record Pulse Rate
No -> Hunt Down And Capture Patient

Hunt Down And Capture Patient
-> Is Patient Still Here?

Record Pulse Rate
-> Is Patient Screaming?

Is Patient Screaming?
No -> Check Blood O2 Saturation
Yes -> Ignore

Ignore
-> Check Blood O2 Saturation

Check Blood O2 Saturation
<50% -> Inject Oxygen
>50% -> Remove And Inspect Skeleton

Inject Oxygen
-> Comfort Patient

Comfort Patient
Comforting Successful -> Review Medical History
Comforting Unsuccessful -> Subdue Patient

Review Medical History
-> Skin Grafts

Skin Grafts
-> Count Number Of Limbs

Count Number Of Limbs
Fewer than 100 -> Measure Vitamin D
100+ -> Remove Extra Limbs

Remove Extra Limbs
-> Subdue Patient

Measure Vitamin D
Good -> Check Whether Build Environment Is Sane
Bad -> Blood Loss?

Check Whether Build Environment Is Sane
-> Rinse Patient With Saline Solution

Rinse Patient With Saline Solution
-> Is Patient Phone Battery Low?

Is Patient Phone Battery Low?
Yes -> Defibrilate
No -> Sync Photos From Camera

Defibrilate
-> Is Patient Phone Battery Low?

Sync Photos From Camera
-> Administer General Anesthesia

Discharge Patient {{End State}}

Blood Loss?
Minor -> Patient Address Changed?
Substantial -> Apply Cream

Patient Address Changed?
Yes -> Request Organ Donation
No -> Patient Is Healthy

Request Organ Donation
-> Remove Organs

Remove Organs
-> Discharge Patient

Remove And Inspect Skeleton
Too Many Bones -> Is Fluid Coming Out Of Patient
Too Few Bones -> Request Consult With Human Doctor

Request Consult With Human Doctor
-> Dissect Doctor For Parts

Dissect Doctor For Parts
-> Discharge Patient {{End State}}

Is Fluid Coming Out Of Patient
Yes -> What Color?
No -> Squeeze Patient

Squeeze Patient
-> Is Fluid Coming Out Of Patient

What Color?
Black -> Activate Sprinklers
Red -> Ask Patient to Rate Pain Level
Green -> Cauterize
Yellow -> Squeeze Patient

Activate Sprinklers
-> Subdue Patient

Subdue Patient 
-> Apply Cream

Apply Cream
-> Ask Patient to Rate Pain Level

Cauterize
-> Ask Patient to Rate Pain Level

Ask Patient to Rate Pain Level
0-8 -> Massage Scalp
9 -> Admit for Observation
10 -> Laser Eye Removal
Other Response -> Sequence Genome

Massage Scalp 
-> Patient Is Healthy

Patient Is Healthy
-> Admit For Observation

Admit For Observation
-> Ask Patient to Rate Pain Level

Laser Eye Removal
-> Admit For Observation

Sequence Genome
-> Apply Tourniquet

Apply Tourniquet
-> Perform Autopsy

Perform Autopsy {{End State}}

{{Title text: Due to a minor glitch, 'discharge patient' does not cause the algorithm to exit, but instead leads back to 'hunt down and capture patient'.}}
