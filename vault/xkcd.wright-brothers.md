## Transcript
[[A man and a woman are talking to each other]]
Man: I've heard that when the Wright brothers argued, they periodically switched sides in the debate to try to encourage a more balanced conclusion.
Man: We should try that in our relationship!
Woman: It's a neat idea, but I think treating personal issues like a debate will only engender hostility and hurt feelings.
Man: No, I think it would help, by forcing us to consider the other person's point of view.
Woman: Hmm, maybe you're right.
Man: Am not.  It's a bad idea.
