## Transcript
[[An algebra teacher by the name of Miss Lenhart, a former student, and a bystander.  Miss Lenhart is walking away while the former student shouts at her the following:]]
Former Student: Hey, Miss Lenhart! I forgot everything about algebra the moment I graduated, and in 20 years no one has needed me to solve *anything* for X.  I *told you* I'd never use it! In your *face*!
It's weird how proud people are of not learning math when the same arguments apply to learning to play music, cook, or speak a foreign language.
