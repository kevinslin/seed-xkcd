## Transcript
The Fermi Paradox: Planets are so common that life should be too. So where is it?
[[A person with an unusual suit runs.]]

Well, now we know.  It's not that life inevitably destroys itself with war.
[[The person keeps running.]]

It's just that it takes longer to develop space colonization.
[[The person leaps off a cliff]]
Than it does to invent an activity..

..more fun than survival.
[[Youtube video of the person, with the suit opening up into a wingsuit. As this is youtube, the comments have not been shown.  Two people are watching the video offpanel.]]
Person 1: Holy crap.
Person 2: I don't care how dangerous it is. I have to try it.
