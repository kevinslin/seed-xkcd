Hydrogen can form four bonds.  It readily bonds with itself, and often exists as a crystal.
((Image of several letters H "bonded" labeled crystalline hydrogen))

((Capital letter C with circles on each end of the letter))
Carbon can only form two bonds.  It readily bonds with hydrogen to form CâH (mydrane) or itself.
((Image of two letters C linked labeled Câ))
((Image of two letters C linked with a letter H between them labeled CâH))

((Capital letter O))
Oxygen is inert, forming no bonds...
((Image of several letters O labeled monatomic oxygen gas))
