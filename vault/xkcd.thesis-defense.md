## Transcript
[[A woman runs towards a desk with two microphones on it, waving a broadsword high in the air. Two figures sitting behind the desk are taken aback, while a woman standing off to the side holds an arm in front of her face protectively. A slide is projected on a screen behind the sword-reading woman, reading "The evolution of threat defence in mammals".]]

Sword-wielding woman: In conclusion, AAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!
The best thesis defence is a good thesis offence.
