![Proof of Zermelo's well-ordering theorem given the Axiom of Choice: 1: Take S to be any set. 2: When I reach step three, if S hasn't managed to find a well-ordering relation for itself, I'll feed it into this wood chipper. 3: Hey, look, S is well-ordered.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/set_theory.png)

## Transcript
[[A woman with a ponytail stands at a blackboard, facing away from it. She has a pointer in her hand, and written on the blackboard is some set theory math.]]
Woman: The axiom of choice allows you to select one element from each set in a collection -- and have it 
executed
 as an example to the others.
