## Transcript
[[A girl stands on the left.  A man is sitting on the floor with a game controller in his hand.  He is looking at a TV on the floor connected to a game console, also on the floor.]]
Girl: Can you pause for a moment and help me with something?
Man: You know, our love is like a katamari.  We travel along, rolling up more and more of the world into our shared experience, taking it and making it our own.
Girl: I, you... wow.  Geekiness aside, that was actually incredibly sweet.
Man: The clutter of everyday life, with a simple core to tie it together, eventually becomes something grand as the world itself.
[[A rainbow extends outward from the TV, with "ROYAL RAINBOW!" above it.]]
Girl: Okay, also sweet, but now I'm wondering if you could possibly get any gayer.
