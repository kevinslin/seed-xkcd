## Transcript
[[A person sits at a desk, looking at a laptop screen with one hand on his chin.]]
Person: So I thought I found your porn folder, in calendar
backup
PORN
 --
Person #2 (off screen): Don't open that!

[[A wider shot of the person looking at the laptop.]]
Person #1: But it contains a bunch more folders, filled with more folders, and then... after 20 levels, somehow I'm back at the main folder?
Person #2 (off screen): It's, uh, well hidden.

[[The person has turned around in the chair, now with the laptop in his lap.]]
Person #1: I think there's no actual porn here. - You're just turned on by filesystems.
Person #2 (off screen): It's a hardlinked directory loop -- so taboo!
Person #1: Now I feel dirty sharing a drive with you.
