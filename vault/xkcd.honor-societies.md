## Transcript
[[A student sits at a desk, while a teacher or counselor out of frame advises]]
Student: Wait. I should join this honor society to show colleges I'm honorable, and I'm honorable because I'm in an honor society?
Teacher: Basically, yes.

[[Tighter shot of student]]
Student: Sounds like I could save time by joining the Tautology Club directly.
Teacher: That's not a real club.
Student: Then I'm starting it.

TAUTOLOGY CLUB
[[Seven individuals appear: a blonde girl, a man, a shorter male with glasses that bears a striking resemblance to Jason Fox, a taller man with a buzz cut, a brunette woman with curly hair in a ponytail, a brunette woman with straight hair, and finally our student, standing on a box.]]
Blonde Girl: So how'd you learn about us?
Man: From your Facebook group, "If 1,000,000 People Join This Group, It Will Have 1,000,000 People In It."
Student: LISTEN UP! The first rule of Tautology Club is the first rule of Tautology Club.
