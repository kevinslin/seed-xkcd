## Transcript
[[A man is going through a cardboard box marked "MISC", and finds a catalog. A woman looks on.]]
Man: Check it out -- old 
Computer Shoppers
! Wow -- in 1996, $3,000 would get you a 100 MHz Pentium system with a parallel port, 
two
 serial ports, a 2MB video card, and "MS-Windows"
Woman: 
Nice!


[[The two are face-to-face, and they each have a separate copy of Computer Shopper.]]
Woman: And $299 would get you a Palm Pilot 100- -- 16MHz, 128Kb storage, and a memo pad, calendar, and state-of-the-art address book that can store over 100 names!
Man: Oooh!

[[The man continues to read from his.]]
Man: And $110 would get you a bulky TI graphing calculator with around 10MHz CPU, 24Kb RAM, and a 96x64-pixel B
W display!
Woman: Times sure have... ...have... uh.

[[They both put down their catalogs.]]
Man: Okay, what the hell, T.I.?
Woman: Maybe they cost so much now because there's only one engineer left who remembers how to make displays 
that
 crappy.
