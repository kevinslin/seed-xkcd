## Transcript
[[Girl and beret guy stand under the stars]]
Girl: The starlight falls on our eyes after a journey across trillions of miles - dying here at last, so far from home, all so we can see some pretty dots.
[[Beret guy think for a moment, then runs away, comes back with a mirror, and holds it up towards the stars]]
