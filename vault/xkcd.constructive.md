## Transcript
[[A man is talking to a woman]]
Man: Spammers are breaking traditional captchas with AI, so I've built a new system. It asks users to rate a slate of comments as "Constructive" or "Not constructive".
[[Close up of man]]
Man: Then it has them reply with comments of their own, which are later rated by other users.
[[Woman standing next to man again]]
Woman: But what will you do when spammers train their bots to make automated constructive and helpful comments?
[[Close up of man again]]
Man: Mission. Fucking. Accomplished.
