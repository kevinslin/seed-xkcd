![People get really grumpy when they realize you're giving them directions for how to go to the store and buy a GPS.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/kolmogorov_directions.png)

## Transcript
[[A man stands talking on his cellphone.]]
Phone: How do I get to your place from Lexington? 
Man: Hmm... OK, starting from your driveway, take every left that doesn't put you on a prime-numbered highway or street named for a president. 
When people ask for step-by-step directions, I worry that there will be too many steps to remember, so I try to put them in minimal form.
