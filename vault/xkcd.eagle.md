## Transcript
[[A researcher is looking up into a tree, holding a clipboard in one hand and a radio in the other.]]
Researcher: The eagle has left the nest.
Off-Panel: *KHHHKHT* Roger that. Alert the agents.  *KHKKHHKT*
Researcher: Will you stop that?

My hobby: Following field biologists around and interpreting everything they say as code phrases.
