## Transcript
[[A man and a woman are talking]]
Woman: I worry that I'm just with you because it's familiar. Of course no one else compares. I've known you for so long that I'd have to spend years with someone to build up this kind of connection 
and I daren't let you go of you long enough to let that happen.
Woman: But I guess this is really all I can ask for.
I'm happy with you; I should stop worrying.
[[Woman takes man's hand]]
Man: This is probably a bad time to bring this up, but I don't actually like you.
