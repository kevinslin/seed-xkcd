## Transcript
{{Title text: Ok, but make sure to get lots of pieces of rock, because later we'll decide to stay in a room on our regular orb and watch hammers hold themselves and hit rocks for us, and they won't bring us very many rocks.}}

Person 1: You know that glowing orb in the night sky?
Person 2: Yeah?
Person 1: Let's go hit it with a hammer until little pieces break off, then bring the pieces back and lock them in a closet.
Person 2: Sounds good!

The Apollo program was weird.
