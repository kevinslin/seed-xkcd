## Transcript
[[Beret guy and another man stand talking to each other.]]
Beret guy: What've you been up to lately? 
Man: I've been hanging out with some pickup artists. I'm learning a *lot!*
Beret guy: Oh, that sounds like fun! 
The world seems like a happier place if you think "Pickup artist" is like "Pickup basketball player."
