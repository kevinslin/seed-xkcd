## Transcript
[[Someone with curly hair is standing in front of a sign labeled 'Auditions'.  A judge of some sort speaks from off-panel.]]
Judge:

Judge: Sorry, no, that's a huge mood killer.
Judge:

Before I have a kid, I'm moving to Rogers Street in Cambridge, MA, and then getting a cat named "Mister"
Just to guarantee the kid will never go into porn.
