![I was going to record an album with that cover under the name "PINK FTFY", so it'd come after them on the store CD rack. But at this point music stores are just rooms where CDs are set out to age before they're thrown away, so probably nobody would see it.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/dorm_poster.png)

## Transcript
[[Person 1 finds dorm room]]

[[View into the dorm room.  The left half is already occupied, and Person 2 has filled his side with the normal accoutrements of dorm life.  There is a Pink Floyd "Dark Side of the Moon" poster hanging on the far wall, offset and only on Person 2's side]]

[[Person 1 has a bit of a ponder]]

[[Person 1 leaves for a bit]]

[[Person 1 returns with an item]]

[[View into the dorm room.  Person 1 is moving in, and has placed a second Pink Floyd "Dark Side of the Moon" poster modified with a lens in the rainbow's path.  The poster is placed upside down on Person 1's side of the far wall to catch the rainbow, feed it back into the prism, and turn it back into a narrow stream of white light.]]
