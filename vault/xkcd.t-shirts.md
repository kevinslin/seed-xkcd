## Transcript
[[A collection of phrases on T-shirts]]
I see dumb people
As a matter of fact the world DOES revolve around me
I can only please one person per day today is not your day.
You know what your problem is? You're stupid.
Get a clue
Do I look like a people person?
Your village called they want their idiot back
Go away
I hate you all
DIE.
Help.
Maybe if this T-shirt is witty enough, someone will finally love me.
Oh God I'm so alone
