My Hobby:
Pausing in-store music for a split second and watching the ex-marching band kids stumble.
[[On a balcony overlooking a supermarket, a man presses a button on a pedestal. The in-store music, the first four bars of "Never Gonna Give You Up" by Rick Astley, pauses briefly after the third bar, and one of the store's patrons falls on her face.]]
