## Transcript
[[Picture of a right hand with fingers curved, thumb pointed away, with axes drawn to demonstrate the right-hand rule of physics]]
Alternatives to the Right-Hand Rule in vector multiplication:
[[A slightly-open book with labeled axes drawn on.]]
Book Rule: Open the front cover along the first vector and the back cover along the second. The result vector is along the spine, out the top.
[[A handgun with axes.]]
Handgun Rule: Point the grip along the first vector and rotate it so that the second vector is on the safety latch side. Fire. The result vector is toward the bullet holes.
[[A person with right arm extended.]]
Body Rule (males only): Point your right arm along the first vector and your legs along the second, then watch some porn.
