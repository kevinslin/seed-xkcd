## Transcript
Person (on phone): It's 2011. I want my flying car.
Friend (from phone): Dude.

Friend: You're complaining to me using a phone on which you buy and read books,

Friend: and which you were using to play a 3D shooter until I interrupted you with what would be a video call if I were wearing a shirt.

Person: Can't I have a flying car, too?
Friend (from phone): You'd crash it while texting and playing Angry Birds.
