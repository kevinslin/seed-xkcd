## Transcript
This happened to my friend:
[[Men and women are standing in a row]]
Man: English should be the national language. These immigrants should have to learn English when they come here.
Woman: Yeah
Man: When you go to live somewhere, you learn the language they speak there. English is the language of the land.
Other Woman: Excuse me, but osio Sarah dawado.
Man: What the hell was that?
Other Woman: Woman: Cherokee.
