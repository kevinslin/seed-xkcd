## Transcript
[[Person is on the phone, and holding up some networking hardware.]]
Person: ... restart my computer? I know you have a script to follow, but the uplink light on the modem is going off every few hours. The problem is between your office and the modem.

Person: My computer has nothing to do with ... okay, whatever, I "restarted my computer."
Person: It's still down, and even if it comes back, it's going to die again in a few hours, because your--

Person: I don't HAVE a start menu. This is a Haiku install, but that's not import--
Person: Haiku? It's an experimental OS that I ... oh, never mind.

Engineer: Don't tell anyone.

Person: Oh my god, this is the greatest--
[[Person wakes up.]]
Person: Wha--
Person: ... DAMMIT.
