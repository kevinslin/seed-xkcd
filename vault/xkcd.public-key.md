![I guess I should be signing stuff, but I've never been sure what to sign. Maybe if I post my private key, I can crowdsource my decisions about what to sign.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/public_key.png)

## Transcript
[[Character sits alone at a desk.. drifting in an infinite white void..]]
Character, thinking: I've been posting my public key for fifteen years now, but no one has ever asked me for it or used it for anything as far as I can tell.

[[A frame of silence.]]

[[Another frame of silence.]]

Character, thinking more: Maybe I should try posting my PRIVATE key instead.
