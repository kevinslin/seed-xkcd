## Transcript
[[A stick figure is standing, holding a CD tray which is half-in his computer. There are other CDs on the floor.]]
Stick Figure: Hey. Hey! Stop retracting my CD!
[[Label: I feel uncomfortable when my computer physically struggles with me. Sure, I can overpower it _now_, but it feels like a few short steps from here to the robot wars.]]
