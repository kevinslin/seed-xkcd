!["Oh, you're using their Chrome APP, not their Chrome EXTENSION. They're very similar but one handles window creation differently." is a thing I hope I can stop saying soon.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/troubleshooting.png)

## Transcript
[[Two characters sit at a computer. The hair'd one sits at the controls, and the bald one hovers impatiently behind.]]
Hair'd character: Wait, why can't I click anywhere?
Bald character: I don't... ugh, it opened a dialog box offscreen.
Hair'd character: Why is that even POSSIBLE?
Bald character: It really shouldn't be. But you can fix it by changing your screen resolution to trigger a window cleanup.
Hair'd character: SERIOUSLY?
Bald character: I know, I know...

Caption: To be honest, I can't WAIT for the day when all my stupid computer knowledge becomes obsolete.
