Student: ((Wait. I don't think I've been attending. I must have forgotten I had this class. Shitshitshit.))
Student: ((Okay, I'm gonna fail. Will it hold me back? I just want to get out of here. I thought I had <i>finished<
i> my requirements already.))
Student: ((In fact, I think I remember graduating.))
Student: ((What the hell is--))
