## Transcript
[[One man sits at a computer. Another stands behind him, talking.]]
Man #2: I've been putting all my stuff in Chad's Garage. He has nice shelves. And he lets me in to see it whenever I want. 

[[We see a handwritten note.]]
Man #2: But I just got this note from him:
Note: Dude, in like a month im gonna Craigslist all that shit you left in my garage. Just FYI. -- Chad

[[A close-up of man #2.]]
Man #2: It's an *outrage*! This is no way to run a storage business! 
Man #1: Are you paying him to look after your stuff? 

[[We see both characters again, as in panel #1.]]
Man #2: No.
Man #1: Then what he runs isn't a storage business.
Man #2: Well, I'm *this* close to not giving him any more stuff. 
Man #1: That'll teach him.
