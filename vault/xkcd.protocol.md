## Transcript
[[A standing figure is conversing with another figure who is sitting on computer desk chair. Behind the sitting figure is a desk with a flat-panel monitor.]]
Standing figure: Alice sends a message to Bob saying to meet her somewhere.
Sitting figure: Uh huh.
Standing figure: But Eve sees it, too, and goes to the place.
Sitting figure: With you so far.
Standing figure: Bob is delayed, and Alice and Eve meet.
Sitting figure: Yeah?

I've discovered a way to get computer scientists to listen to any boring story.
