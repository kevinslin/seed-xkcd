## Transcript
[[ Landscape in the background, canyon with a winding road ]]
Maybe engineering is the pursuit of an unattainable perfection.
Maybe it's impossible to create something bug-free.
Maybe I'm a fool
Maybe the tyranny of Murphy is the penalty for hubris.
But I just can't shake the feeling
[[ man standing on a box labeled "ACME" ]]
With all those supplies
_I_ could have caught that roadrunner.
{{Alt: Chuck Jones is a vengeful god. }}
