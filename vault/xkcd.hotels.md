## Transcript
[[Person 1 is sitting at a desk with a laptop, looking at a review website]]
Person 1: What's with this negative review? You *liked* that hotel.
Black Hat Man: I have a script that posts a bad review for every hotel I stay at. It reduces demand, which means more vacancies and lower prices next time.

Person 1: What if the place sucks?
Black Hat Man: I change the review to positive to steer other people over there.

Person 1: You punish companies you like!
Black Hat Man: The odds of *my* review putting a hotel out of business are negligible.
Person 1: If we all did that the system would collapse!
Black Hat Man: Doesn't affect my logic. Tragedy of the commons.

Person 1: That's not even the tragedy of the commons anymore.  That's the tragedy of you're a dick.
Black Hat Man: If you're quick with a knife, you'll find that the invisible hand is made of delicious invisible meat.
