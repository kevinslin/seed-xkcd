![And thus was smallpox introduced into the previously Undying Lands.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/columbus.png)

## Transcript
[[A figure in a hat is talking to two small children who are sitting cross-legged on the floor. A woman is off-panel.]]
Figure in hat: Everyone said the world was flat, but Columbus knew it was round. 
Woman: <<Sigh>> No, no, no. 

[[The woman walks into frame. The children turn to look.]]
Woman: So he took his ships and sailed west in a line tangent to the surface. The sea fell away, and he landed in *Valinor*. 

Woman: A Silmaril on his brow, he wanders the heavens as the morning star, still believing he reached India. 
Figure in hat: Stop making stuff up. 
Woman: You first.
