## Transcript
[[A man gets into bed.]]
It's so much easier
falling asleep

[[A woman is lying in bed, gripping her pillow.]]
With you beside me--

[[The man is lying on his back in bed.]]
All the incentive I need

[[Full shot of the bed, the woman is on the left, gripping the pillow, the man is as far to the right as possible, nearly falling off, facing away from her.]]
To leave the world behind.
