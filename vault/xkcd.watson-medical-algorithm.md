## Transcript
[[A figure stands by a pit, while a woman is in the pit opening a container. There's a shovel and some earth to the side.]]
Woman: All right, let's open the time capsule. 

[[The lid is off the capsule. Inside is Beret Guy.]]
Beret guy: Hi!
Woman: Where did you come from?!
Beret guy: The past! I traveled here in this time machine. 

Figure: How did you... get here from the past? 
Beret guy: I dunno. I couldn't not.
Figure: But... what did you eat? 
Beret guy: Newspapers, mostly.

[[Beret guy holds up a hammer.]]
Beret guy: Anyway, I'm here to kill Hitler.
Woman: But he died long ago!
Beret guy: Oh, good! That was easy. Want to get sandwiches? Do you still have sandwiches?

{{Title text: Oh no, I changed the future and now I'm disappearing! Wait, never mind, it was just my hat slipping down over my eyes.}}
