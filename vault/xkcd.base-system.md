## Transcript
[[A man and woman are talking; she's sitting on the back of a chair with her feet on the seat, and he's sitting on the floor facing her.]]
Woman: So how far did you get with her?
Man: Second base?

Woman: Wait, which one is that? Below the waist, but... not under the clothes?
Man: I think that's... shortstop?

Woman: You should try crossing the pitcher's mound. Then down the 50-yard line, and right past her ten-pin.
Man: Sounds tricky.

Woman: Yeah. Last time I tried it, I got a red flag. If you know what I mean.
Man: I really don't.
