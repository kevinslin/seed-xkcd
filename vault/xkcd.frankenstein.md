## Transcript
Like many people, I'm tired of nitpicking about Frankenstein's Monster's name.
Luckily, 
Frankenstein
 is public domain.
Therefore, I present
XKCD'S

FRANKENSTEIN

[Lightning bolt]
(The monster's name)
[[No illustration, just centered text leading to a title with a small lightning bolt at the bottom.]]

[[A man with a flat-top haircut lies under a blanket on a gurney, with wires leading from his neck. A person throws a large switch on the wall.]]
Monster: 
GRAAAR!

Doctor: Frankenstein is alive! I am a modern Prometheus!
Monster: RAAAAR!
Doctor: To be clear, your name is 
Frankenstein
. Canonically.
Monster: 
GRAAAAAR!
 The moon landings were faked!
Doctor: Wait, what?

~Fin.~
There. Feel free to call the monster "Frankenstein."
If anyone tries to correct you, just explain that this comic is your canonical version.
Thank you.
[[Again, no illustration, just text.]]

{{Title text: "Wait, so in this version is Frankenstein also the doctor's name?" "No, he's just 'The Doctor'."}}
