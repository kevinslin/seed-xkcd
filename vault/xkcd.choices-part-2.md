]]
Boy: <<sigh>>
[[Label: Meanwhile:]]
[[A girl in a bubble and a spacecraft are moving towards each other. Each one has a velocity vector drawn before themselves, each showing a velocity of 0.2c.]]
[[They pass each other.]]
Spacecraft: We observe your speed to be 38.5%c, and your time is passing at 92.3% the rate of ours. Does this mirror your observations?
Girl: Please help me. I think I'm lost.
[[They continue with the same velocity vectors. The girl is looking back at the spacecraft.]]
