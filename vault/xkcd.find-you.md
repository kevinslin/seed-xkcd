## Transcript
[[The panel is black with rough-edged white passages running down through it. A stick figure is holding onto a rope, dangling down one of these passages. White text is in the black sections.]]
You were afraid that you would disappear, that you would be lost and forgotten.
I held you tight against the dark and said that I would always come for you.
Then one day it happened. You were torn from my arms and vanished from this world.
Maybe you don't remember my promise. But I meant every word.
I hope you're not afraid, wherever you are.
You don't need to be.
I'm not.
I will find you.
