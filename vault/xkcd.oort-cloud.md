## Transcript
[[3 asteroids are talking.]]
Asteroid 1: Have you noticed that bright dot in the distance? 
Asteroid 2: Yeah. What's the deal with it? 

[[Asteroid 1 scoots off-panel.]]
Asteroid 1: Dunno. I'm gonna go check it out. 

[[Asteroids 2 and 3 sit and wait.]]

[[Asteroid 1 has returned, as pieces of rubble and dust.]]
Asteroid 1: Wow. Do not go over there.
