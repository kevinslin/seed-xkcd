## Transcript
[[A programmer sits at a desk in front of a computer. There are cans on the desk and more crushed ones on the floor.]]
Programmer: I just wrote the most beautiful code of my life.

Programmer: They casually handed me an impossible problem. In 48 hours and 200 lines, I SOLVED it.

((Lines divide the comic into two possible end panels here, labeled "Academia" and "Business."))

[[Academia]]
Professor: My god ... this will mean a half-dozen papers, a thesis or two, and a paragraph in every textbook on queueing theory!

[[Business]]
Boss: You got the program to stop jamming up? Great. While you're fixing stuff, can you get Outlook to sync with our new phones?
