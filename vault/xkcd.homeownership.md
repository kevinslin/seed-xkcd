## Transcript
[[Person is in an empty room, on the phone with a friend.]]
Person: I've always rented, so this blows my mind--this house is mine? I own a building?
Friend: Yup!

Person: I could, like, decide to drill a hole in that wall there, and nobody could do anything about it!
Friend: That's right!

[[Person, off the phone, stands in silence.]]

[[Person is standing next to a pile of rubble, on the phone with a friend.]]
Person: Can I come stay with you? My house has a ... problem.
Friend: Let me guess: you drilled holes in it until it collapsed?
Person: I don't think I'm cut out for home ownership.
